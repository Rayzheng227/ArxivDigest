The aim of this research is to present a way to solve all instances of the Subset Sum Problem in quadratic time worst case. With showing that the solution functions within polynomial time, it would hence prove that indeed P equals NP, theoretically that is. When it comes to the practical extension of the solution to the NP class, reductions would have to be tailored and standardized due to the diverse constraints and structures the NP problems come with. All these diverse constraints cannot be practically piped to Subset Sum form the same way. Since some NP problems have similarities in constraints, standardized reductions can be reused with little to no adaptation. The greater our pool of constraint-standard-reduction, the easier it will be to learn from them and reduce NP problems coming with similar constraints to Subset Sum, and solve them efficiently by the method to be presented. We also present a way of reducing k-SAT and general CNF-SAT instances to Subset Sum in linear time and only touch base on how to solve the SAT instances reduced to Subset Sum. As this paper focuses on efficiently solving the Subset Sum, a follow up paper will extensively detail the extension of the solution to k-SAT and CNF-SAT."}

Despite its computational hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet no efficient representation by known models, assuming $\\textsf{FP}\\neq\\#\\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\\textsf{P} \\neq \\textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are efficiently computable on the known circuit models.

To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced.

To enhance the security and trust for TLS 1.3 in such scenarios, we propose LURK-T, a provably secure framework which allows for limited use of remote keys with added trust in TLS 1.3. We efficiently decouple the server side of TLS 1.3 into a LURK-T Crypto Service (CS) and a LURK-T Engine (E). CS executes all cryptographic operations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), upon E's requests. CS and E together provide the whole TLS-server functionality. A major benefit of our construction is that it is application agnostic; the LURK-T Crypto Service could be collocated with the LURK-T Engine, or it could run on different machines. Thus, our design allows for in situ attestation and protection of the cryptographic side of the TLS server, as well as for all setups of CDNs over TLS. To support such a generic decoupling, we provide a full Application Programming Interface (API) for LURK-T. To this end, we implement our LURK-T Crypto Service using Intel SGX and integrate it with OpenSSL. We also test LURK-T's efficiency and show that, from a TLS-client's perspective, HTTPS servers using LURK-T instead a traditional TLS-server have no noticeable overhead when serving files greater than 1MB.

Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion, enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision translates into better situational awareness in the oceans."}

Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES, ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted.

The causal analysis shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA.

We propose EMERGENT, a novel application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching, leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions.

This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews.

While effective, MAR models suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a training-free generation framework MARch\u00e9 to address this inefficiency through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh. Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\u00e9 recognizes this challenge and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation, while preserving image generation quality. MARch\u00e9 significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\u00e9 achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for efficient masked transformer generation."}

Motivated by the \"golden noise\" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps.

Numerous pruning techniques have been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we \"use a neural network to prune neural networks\". More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art.

Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements. Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting."}

GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently, GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are critical."}

This qualitative research employs systematic document analysis and comparative case study methodology to examine how cybersecurity organizations adapt their threat modeling frameworks and operational processes to address generative artificial intelligence integration. Through examination of 25 studies from 2022 to 2025, the research documents substantial transformation in organizational approaches to threat modeling, moving from traditional signature-based systems toward frameworks incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities. The research identifies three primary adaptation patterns: Large Language Model integration for security applications, GenAI frameworks for risk detection and response automation, and AI/ML integration for threat hunting. Organizations with mature security infrastructures, particularly in finance and critical infrastructure sectors, demonstrate higher readiness through structured governance approaches, dedicated AI teams, and robust incident response processes. Organizations achieve successful GenAI integration when they maintain appropriate human oversight of automated systems, address data quality concerns and explainability requirements, and establish governance frameworks tailored to their specific sectors. Organizations encounter ongoing difficulties with privacy protection, bias reduction, personnel training, and defending against adversarial attacks. This work advances understanding of how organizations adopt innovative technologies in high-stakes environments and offers actionable insights for cybersecurity professionals implementing GenAI systems."}

This problem is not as simple as it looks because of system constraints that cannot be neglected practically. Moreover, increased awareness of clean technology imposes another important limit on the emission of pollutants obtained from burning of fossil fuels. Classical optimization methods lack the ability of solving such a complex and multi-objective problem. Hence, various modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on evolution and social behaviour of organisms are being used to solve such problems because they are easier to implement, give accurate results and take less computational time. In this work, a study is done on most of the contemporary basic AI techniques being used in literature for power systems in general and combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) in particular. The dispatch problem is implemented on IEEE 30-bus benchmarked system in MATLAB for different load demands considering all gases (COX, NOX and SOX) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) and their results are compared with each other."}

This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that high-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study material. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short answers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of various grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from their pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need human oversight, especially in examination scenarios."}

For example, if a user comes to buy a car that has several attributes including speed, color, age, etc in a linear function, the algorithms that we present in this paper help with estimating this linear function to filter out a small subset that would be of best interest to the user among a million tuples in a very large database. In addition, the estimating linear function could also be applicable in getting to know what the data can do or predicting the future based on the data that is used in data science, which is demonstrated by the GNN, PLOD algorithms. In the ever-evolving field of data science, deriving valuable insights from large datasets is critical for informed decision-making, particularly in predictive applications. Data analysts often identify high-quality datasets without missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies before merging diverse attributes for analysis. Taking housing price prediction as a case study, various attributes must be considered, including location factors (proximity to urban centers, crime rates), property features (size, style, modernity), and regional policies (tax implications). Experts in the field typically rank these attributes to establish a predictive utility function, which machine learning models use to forecast outcomes like housing prices. Several data discovery algorithms, including those that address the challenges of predefined utility functions and human input for attribute ranking, which often result in a time-consuming iterative process, that the work of cannot overcome."}

This paper introduces T$^2$-RAGBench, a benchmark comprising 32,908 question-context-answer triples, designed to evaluate RAG methods on real-world financial data. Unlike typical QA datasets that operate under Oracle-context settings, where the relevant context is explicitly provided, T$^2$-RAGBench challenges models to first retrieve the correct context before conducting numerical reasoning. Existing QA datasets involving text and tables typically contain context-dependent questions, which may yield multiple correct answers depending on the provided context. To address this, we transform these datasets into a context-independent format, enabling reliable RAG evaluation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of popular RAG methods. Our analysis identifies Hybrid BM25, a technique that combines dense and sparse vectors, as the most effective approach for text-and-table data. However, results demonstrate that T$^2$-RAGBench remains challenging even for SOTA LLMs and RAG methods. Further ablation studies examine the impact of embedding models and corpus size on retrieval performance.

To address this gap, we introduce WebTrust, a system designed to simplify the process of finding and judging credible information online. Built on a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B model and trained on a custom dataset, WebTrust works by assigning a reliability score (from 0.1 to 1) to each statement it processes. In addition, it offers a clear justification for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2. User testing showed that when reliability scores are displayed alongside search results, people feel more confident and satisfied with the information they find. With its accuracy, transparency, and ease of use, WebTrust offers a practical solution to help combat misinformation and make trustworthy information more accessible to everyone."}

The initial step involves selecting ICL demonstrations using the effectiveness rule, followed by a second step that determines whether the chosen demonstrations should be utilized, based on the informativeness rule. We also provide an analytical framework for both informativeness and effectiveness rules. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated with a real-world fifth-generation (5G) dataset with different application scenarios.

This study addresses the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme, subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph. We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed and inclusive curricular decisions.

While using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation, learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned; it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from -- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological perspective."}

This study examines how LLMs naturally moderate climate change conversations through their distinct communicative behaviors. We conduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on social media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI and Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the emotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results reveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs consistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment than human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across contexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings suggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the quality of public discourse on controversial topics. This research enhances our understanding of how AI might support more civil and constructive climate change discussions and informs the design of AI-assisted communication tools."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more stable and realistic emergent behaviors."}

We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing indicator.

This formulation presents a computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing indicator.

We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in approximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and fear enhancement.

In complex settings, the state and action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates."}

In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability."}

This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI."}

Le, Jan Peters, Minh Nhat Vu", "subjects": "Subjects:\nRobotics (cs.RO)", "abstract": "Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental stochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning stability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified in high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further entangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In this work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes uncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and policy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs conformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated risk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic dynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative priors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint (GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent action space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize high-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted exploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite with the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, DoublyAware demonstrates improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared to RL baselines. Our simulation results emphasize the significance of structured uncertainty modeling for data-efficient and reliable decision-making in TD-MPC-based humanoid locomotion learning."}

Autistic people in particular have been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more important to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may promote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these agents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work, we investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these technologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of neurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to users with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often marginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants overlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw about communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of humanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their broader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative assumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish \"humans\" from \"bots\" and the replication of these assumptions in their work.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for cybersecurity threat analysis. When querying LLMs, dealing with new, unseen vulnerabilities is particularly challenging as it lies outside LLMs' pre-trained distribution. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines mitigate the problem by injecting up-to-date authoritative sources into the model context, thus reducing hallucinations and increasing the accuracy in responses. Meanwhile, the deployment of LLMs in security-sensitive environments introduces challenges around trust and safety. This raises a critical open question: How to quantify or attribute the generated response to the retrieved context versus the model's pre-trained knowledge? This work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) -- a novel, explainable metric to paint a clear picture on the 'percentage of influence' the pre-trained knowledge vs. retrieved content has for each generated response. We apply LEA to assess responses to 100 critical CVEs from the past decade, verifying its effectiveness to quantify the insightfulness for vulnerability analysis. Our development of LEA reveals a progression of independency in hidden states of LLMs: heavy reliance on context in early layers, which enables the derivation of LEA; increased independency in later layers, which sheds light on why scale is essential for LLM's effectiveness. This work provides security analysts a means to audit LLM-assisted workflows, laying the groundwork for transparent, high-assurance deployments of RAG-enhanced LLMs in cybersecurity operations."}

By interacting with external environments through predefined tools, these agents can carry out complex user tasks. Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo benchmark, demonstrating its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse models -- showcasing both its robustness and adaptability."}

To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45 video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms induced by static occlusions.

These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits. Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of \"cognitive tools\" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our \"cognitive tools\" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview. In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities."}

In this paper, we propose a novel merging DBA algorithm, called the Dynamic Time and Wavelength Allocation (DTWA) algorithm, for a virtualized DBA (vDBA) architecture in multi-tenant PON environments. The Algorithm, which enables the merging of multiple virtual DBAs into a physical bandwidth map, introduces multi-channel support, allowing each Optical Network Unit (ONU) to dynamically change, taking into consideration different switching times, transmission wavelength. Leveraging the Numba APIs for high-performance optimization, the algorithm achieves real-time performance with minimal additional latency, meeting the stringent requirements of SLA-compliant, latency-critical 6G applications and services. Our analysis highlights an important trade-off in terms of throughput in multi-tenant conditions, between single-channel vs. multi-channel PONs, as a function of ONUs tuning time. We also compare the performance of our algorithm for different traffic distributions.

In this paper, we propose a novel perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly. First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter, training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that this can be resolved via reusing data.

Modern LLMs exhibit impressive ability to memorize training data, but data not deemed important during training is forgotten, and information outside that training set cannot be made use of. Processing an entire dataset at inference time is infeasible due to the bounded nature of model resources (e.g. context size in transformers or states in state space models), meaning we must resort to external memory. This constraint naturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the present query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data matters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at test-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval method that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of documents for answer generation. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which relies on external heuristics for document retrieval, our approach leverages direct feedback from the model. Theoretically, we show that standard top-$k$ retrieval with model gradients can approximate our optimization procedure, and provide connections to the leave-one-out loss. We demonstrate empirically that by minimizing an unsupervised loss objective in the form of question perplexity, we can achieve comparable retriever metric performance to BM25 with \\emph{no finetuning}. Furthermore, when evaluated on quality of the final prediction, our method often outperforms fine-tuned dense retrievers such as E5."}

Such conversation is a new capability that traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well, understanding that their success will be measured by the student's comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see us fall increasingly far from understanding them."}

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes."}

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings.

Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16). In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates.

Given a new dataset, they need to determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively. Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain. We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies. Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments. Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data."}

Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both synthetic ($y = x \\sin(x) + \\epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\\lambda(f)$ scores indicate strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with respect to the ground truth.

We focus on two widely used prompting strategies - standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model- and scale-dependent.

Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART - a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations. SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a real-world object under spare segmentation supervision.

Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level."}

However, recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes, allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks.

Driven by advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive fields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often struggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging scenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their reliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along with the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named InceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic cues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the multi-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell boundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines an Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high efficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the regions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features are fused to get the final segmentation mask. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging microscopic segmentation datasets (SegPC21 and GlaS) and two skin lesion segmentation datasets (ISIC2017 and ISIC2018), while reducing computational cost by about 5 times compared to the previous best performing method."}

Notably, federated low-rank adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck, and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy. We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID.

In this work, {\\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}.

These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks.

Despite the success, ERM avoids the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization challenging to conventional machine learning. In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM), that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii) interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks. Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often contradicts the objective of ERM..."}

While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness. To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths. Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets."}

Additionally, we explore whether combining these models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models' performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score, others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene attributes.

We frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g., continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1) model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods."}

There are many issues with these forms: they are too long, too complex and demand the user's attention too frequently. Many users consent without reading so do not know what they are agreeing to. As such,granted consent is effectively uninformed. In this paper, we report on two studies we carried out to arrive at a value-driven approach to inform efforts to reduce the length of consent forms. The first study interviewed unemployed users to identify the values they want these forms to satisfy. The second survey study helped us to quantify the values and value creators. To ensure that we understood the particular valuation of the unemployed, we compared their responses to those of an employed demographic and observed no significant differences between their prioritisation on any of the values. However, we did find substantial differences between values and value creators, with effort minimisation being most valued by our participants."}

AI has moved beyond research labs into everyday life, powering customer service chats, personalizing travel, aiding doctors in diagnosis, and supporting educators. What makes this moment particularly compelling is AI's increasing collaborative nature. Rather than replacing humans, AI augments our capabilities -- automating routine tasks, enhancing decisions with data, and enabling creativity in fields like design, music, and writing. The future of work is shifting toward AI agents handling tasks autonomously, with humans as supervisors, strategists, and ethical stewards. This flips the traditional model: instead of humans using AI as a tool, intelligent agents will operate independently within constraints, managing everything from scheduling and customer service to complex workflows. Humans will guide and fine-tune these agents to ensure alignment with goals, values, and context. This shift offers major benefits -- greater efficiency, faster decisions, cost savings, and scalability. But it also brings risks: diminished human oversight, algorithmic bias, security flaws, and a widening skills gap. To navigate this transition, organizations must rethink roles, invest in upskilling, embed ethical principles, and promote transparency. This paper examines the technological and organizational changes needed to enable responsible adoption of AI-first systems -- where autonomy is balanced with human intent, oversight, and values."}

This is especially true in situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large language models, we introduce ProVox (\"Proactive Voice\"), a novel framework that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot. We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use, and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less user burden relative to non-active baselines.

A dataset of 1,424 thin section images from 178 ceramic samples belonging to several archaeological sites across the Levantine area, mostly from the Bronze Age, with few samples dating to the Iron Age, was used to train and evaluate these models. The results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves classification performance, with a ResNet18 model achieving 92.11% accuracy and a ViT reaching 88.34%. Explainability techniques, including Guided Grad-CAM and attention maps, were applied to interpret and visualize the models' decisions, revealing that both CNNs and ViTs successfully focus on key mineralogical features for the classification of the samples into their respective petrographic fabrics. These findings highlight the potential of explainable AI in archaeometric studies, providing a reproducible and efficient methodology for ceramic analysis while maintaining transparency in model decision-making."}

To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations."}

An excellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple networked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and efficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a fleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due to machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process parameters for an entire fleet. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based collaborative recommender system that optimizes process parameters for each machine in a fleet by modeling the problem as a sequential matrix completion task. Our approach leverages spectral clustering and alternating least squares to iteratively refine parameter predictions, enabling real-time collaboration among the machines in a fleet while minimizing the number of experimental trials. We validate our method using a mini 3D printing farm consisting of ten 3D printers for which we optimize acceleration and speed settings to maximize print quality and productivity.

DMDPs can be viewed as a finite directed weighted graph, where in each step, the controller chooses an outgoing edge. An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite trajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal cumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee. We consider the classical mean-payoff (aka limit-average) objective, which is a basic and fundamental objective. Howard's policy iteration algorithm is a popular method for solving DMDPs with mean-payoff objectives. Although Howard's algorithm performs well in practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size.

These problems are given an input set, a so-called universe, and their solution lies within their own universe, e.g. the shortest path between two point is a subset of all possible paths. Due to this, reductions upholding the SSP property require an injective embedding from the universe of the first problem into that of the second. This, however, appears inherently similar to the concept of a Parsimonious reduction, a reduction type requiring a bijective function between the solution spaces of the two problems. Parsimonious reductions are mainly used within the complexity class #P, as this class of problems concerns itself with the number of possible solutions in a given problem. These two concepts, SSP and Parsimonious reductions, are inherently similar but, crucially, not equivalent. We therefore explore the interplay between reductions upholding the SSP and Parsimonious properties, highlighting both the similarities and differences by providing a comprehensive theorem delineating the properties required for reductions to uphold both attributes. We also compile and evaluate 46 reductions between 30 subset search variants of computational problems, including those of classic NP-complete problems such as Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamiltonian Cycle, the Traveling Salesman Problem and Subset Sum, providing reduction proofs, illustrative examples and insights as to where the SSP and Parsimonious properties coexist or diverge. With this compendium we contribute to the understanding of the computational complexity of bilevel and robust optimization problems, by contributing a vast collection of proven SSP- and #P-complete problems."}

This work investigates the core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic, individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80% accuracy.

We found two key areas of concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level. At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges: interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks but neglects the broader community perspective.

In this work, we investigate a training framework that leverages a SQA model, trained to predict multiple evaluation metrics from a public SE leaderboard, as a supervisory signal for SE. This approach addresses a key limitation of conventional SE objectives, such as SI-SNR, which often fail to align with perceptual quality and generalize poorly across evaluation metrics. Moreover, it enables training on real-world data where clean references are unavailable. Experiments on both simulated and real-world test sets show that SQA-guided training consistently improves performance across a range of quality metrics."}

However, these manipulation policies often fail to generalize beyond their training viewpoints, which is a persistent challenge in achieving perspective-agnostic manipulation, especially in settings where the camera is expected to move at runtime. Although collecting data from many angles seems a natural solution, such a naive approach is both resource-intensive and degrades manipulation policy performance due to excessive and unstructured visual diversity. This paper proposes Vantage, a framework that systematically identifies and integrates data from optimal perspectives to train robust, viewpoint-agnostic policies. By formulating viewpoint selection as a continuous optimization problem, we iteratively fine-tune policies on a few vantage points. Since we leverage Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate the infinite space of potential camera configurations, we are able to balance exploration of novel views and exploitation of high-performing ones, thereby ensuring data collection from a minimal number of effective viewpoints. We empirically evaluate this framework on diverse standard manipulation tasks using multiple policy learning methods, demonstrating that fine-tuning with data from strategic camera placements yields substantial performance gains, achieving average improvements of up to 46.19% when compared to fixed, random, or heuristic-based strategies."}

It is important to accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal crosstalk of devices and to study the electrical and thermal characteristics of logic gates, etc. In this work, a thermal network model considering the thermal crosstalk of neighboring devices is proposed, which can accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electrical and thermal characteristics of NSFETs and CFETs are compared, and it is found that CFETs have more severe self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electro-thermal characteristics of inverters, logic gates and ring oscillators composed of NSFETs and CFETs are further investigated.

ECs are particularly useful when deploying VNFs with strict delay and availability requirements. As users roam in the network and get handed over between cells, deployed VNFs must follow users to retain the benefits of edge computing. Yet, having VNFs ready at the closest EC can be challenging: (i) ECs are not usually powerful enough to store and run any combination of VNFs simultaneously; (ii) if a VNF is not available at the needed EC, a series of time-consuming operations has to be performed before the VNF becomes operational. These limitations can be addressed by proactively starting VNFs instances at (likely) future locations, balancing better latency properties against higher resource usage. Such proactive deployment does need forecasting of user movements, but these will be imperfect, creating yet another tradeoff. We present our approach to this service provisioning problem, SWAVES. When compared on the ratio of users' unsuccessful packets, SWAVES improves such metric by orders of magnitude with respect to other proposed heuristic."}

Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge. Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3% on average).

Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity) etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high-precision microprocessors, which are utilized in nowadays robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, but a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing.

However, their potential to generate harmful responses has raised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when manipulated by adversarial techniques known as \"jailbreak\" attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or suffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of these models. In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic complexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any added prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs directly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload. To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a jailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex, information-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. Specifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase malicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is unsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the failure while preserving its malicious intent. We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used LLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their jailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks, achieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing defenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM, fail to mitigate these attacks.

Only awake nodes can send and receive messages in a given round and all messages sent to sleeping nodes are lost. We present new deterministic consensus algorithms that tolerate up to $f<n$ crash failures, where $n$ is the number of nodes.

In this study, we learn human-like interactive driving policies at unsignalized intersections using Deep Fictitious Play. Specifically, we first model vehicle interactions as a Differential Game, which is then reformulated as a Potential Differential Game. The weights in the cost function are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We also demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of convergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play. We validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential Differential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory performance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual weights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and preferences. Furthermore, the ablation study highlights the importance of each component within our model."}

Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay.

For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic task: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities."}

This models the increasingly common trade-off between accurate but expensive similarity measures (e.g., large-scale embeddings) and cheaper but inaccurate alternatives.

In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets.

Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \\to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \\to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that touches $\\leq 0.01\\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating only hundreds of parameters.

In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT.

To address these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design paradigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive output during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee kinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction ratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly increases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes motor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained high-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod mechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization guided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation demonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical improvement of 28.1\\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints).

Compared with unimodality, a more robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network (GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological information and important spectral features during the diffusion process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios."}

Most existing methods have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C, Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla ResNet-18.

However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks (MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LLVLMs, which are inspired by LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs with an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different settings."}

However, it is unclear to what extent the blurred faces can be restored and used to re-identify the person, especially under a high-blurring setting. In this paper, we explore this question by developing a deblurring method called Revelio. The key intuition is to leverage a generative model's memorization effect and approximate the inverse function of Gaussian blur for face restoration. Compared with existing methods, we design the deblurring process to be identity-preserving. It uses a conditional Diffusion model for preliminary face restoration and then uses an identity retrieval model to retrieve related images to further enhance fidelity. We evaluate Revelio with large public face image datasets and show that it can effectively restore blurred faces, especially under a high-blurring setting. It has a re-identification accuracy of 95.9%, outperforming existing solutions. The result suggests that Gaussian blur should not be used for face anonymization purposes. We also demonstrate the robustness of this method against mismatched Gaussian kernel sizes and functions, and test preliminary countermeasures and adaptive attacks to inspire future work."}

However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence.

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC) for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion, TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward \"overthinking\", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps. Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections. In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\\% in train-free settings and 50.2\\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B.

The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance. To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric algorithms.

We trace many of these errors to mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system.

A dynamically optimized regularization length is integrated to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in numerical approximations. A local adaptive mesh refinement strategy is developed, which maintains an optimal balance between mesh resolution and the accurate depiction of fractures using the \\textsf{AT1} diffuse interface model. The total energy functional is comprised of three components: strain energy, surface energy, and a third term reliant on the damage zone's regularization length. The governing partial differential equations for mechanics and phase-field variables, derived from Euler-Lagrange, are discretized via the finite-element method. Two parameters functioning as penalty variables are incorporated; both are asymptotically estimated from the gradient of the phase-field variable. By these estimated parameters, mesh adaptivity is enhanced, ensuring the convergence of the numerical solution. Standard phase-field methods are shown by numerical results to be surpassed by the adaptive model; an accurate representation of fractures is provided, and computational costs are significantly lowered. By employing the proposed spatially adaptive approach, a vastly larger regularization length parameter is achieved compared to other methods throughout the entire computation."}

Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities.

Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline."}

Arvolution renders an agent's historical failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent ``ghosts'' that coexist spatially and temporally with the active agent, enabling an intuitive visualization of policy divergence. Arvolution uniquely integrates: (1) AR visualization of ghost policies, (2) a behavioural taxonomy of DRL maladaptation, (3) a protocol for systematic human disruption to scientifically study failure, and (4) a dual-learning loop where both humans and agents learn from these visualized failures.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of automated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction errors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied scientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two levels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP evaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level graph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and connectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on affiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social register books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where biases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as extraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly pronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of either over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that error models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias patterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG extraction. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners and underscores the importance of advancing extraction methods and error modeling to ensure reliable and meaningful downstream analyses."}

In contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information. By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene."}

To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%."}

One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in decision-making."}

To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances.

The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness and generalizability."}

The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead, trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of 98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable ECG monitoring."}

Relationships between signal characteristics and pitch perception were then analyzed. Results. The synthetic harmonic tones found in the musical sequences under study were observed to transmit more perceived pitches than their acoustic counterparts, with significant variation across listeners.

This paper pioneers a systematic exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers, capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation constraints.

Attackers can implant latent triggers that persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model behavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense mechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker knowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce InverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under minimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack targets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods that rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune effectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key components, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically, InverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation, probabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response patterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to reconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a clustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor function with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the original model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces the average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.

Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here."}

However, they often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by variations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this issue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These approaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve performance by aligning feature distributions between source and target domains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and challenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without relying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various strategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID including the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source input configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization modules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and identity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability of these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that also involves distribution shifts.

To address this challenge, we propose HarMoEny, a novel solution to address MoE load imbalance through two simple techniques: (i) dynamic token redistribution to underutilized GPUs and (ii) asynchronous prefetching of experts from the system to GPU memory. These techniques achieve a near-perfect load balance among experts and GPUs and mitigate delays caused by overloaded GPUs. We implement HarMoEny and compare its latency and throughput with four MoE baselines using real-world and synthetic datasets. Under heavy load imbalance, HarMoEny increases throughput by 37%-70% and reduces time-to-first-token by 34%-41%, compared to the next-best baseline. Moreover, our ablation study demonstrates that HarMoEny's scheduling policy reduces the GPU idling time by up to 84% compared to the baseline policies."}

Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore, the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario identification.

In this paper, we propose a new lifting theorem that establishes connections between two-party communication and the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) communication model. Specifically, we present a deterministic lifting theorem that translates one-way two-party communication lower bounds into one-way NOF lower bounds. Our lifting theorem yields two applications. First, we obtain an optimal explicit separation between randomized and deterministic one-way NOF communication, even in the multi-player setting. This improves the prior square-root vs. constant separation for three players established by Kelley and Lyu (arXiv 2025). Second, we achieve optimal separations between one-round and two-round deterministic NOF communication, improving upon the previous separation of $\\Omega(\\frac{n^{1/(k-1)}}{k^k})$ vs. $O(\\log n)$ for $k$ players, as shown by Viola and Wigderson (FOCS 2007).

Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires, computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies, fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis."}

To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks."}

We propose to learn pseudo-tokens that represent specific visual contexts or appearance attributes using textual inversion network since labels of hand images are indexes instead text descriptions. The learned pseudo-tokens are incorporated into textual prompts which are given as input to the text encoder of the CLIP to leverage its multi-modal reasoning to enhance its generalization for identification.

However, in different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task, enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the financial RE task."}

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks."}

Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin."}

In this paper, we propose a theoretical method to design a Binarization-Aware Adjuster (BAA), which explicitly incorporates binarization behavior into gradient-based optimization. At the core of BAA is a novel loss adjustment mechanism based on a Distance Weight Function (DWF), which reweights pixel-wise contributions according to their correctness and proximity to the decision boundary. This emphasizes decision-critical regions while down-weighting less influential ones. We also introduce a self-adaptive procedure to estimate the optimal binarization threshold for BAA, further aligning training dynamics with inference behavior. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Beyond ED, BAA offers a generalizable strategy for bridging the gap between continuous optimization and discrete evaluation in structured prediction tasks."}

We explore two types of feedback: \"link-level\" and \"path-level\". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path."}

The influencer seeks to maximize her social power by strategically adding a limited number of links to regular agents. This optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the absorbing probability to the influencer in an augmented Markov chain. The resulting objective function is both monotone and submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution. To handle large-scale networks efficiently, a random walk sampling over the Markov chain is employed to reduce computational complexity. Analytical characterizations of the solution are provided for both low and high stubbornness of regular agents. Specific network topologies are also examined: for complete graphs with rank-one weight matrices, the problem reduces to a hyperbolic 0-1 programmming problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; for symmetric ring graphs with circulant weight matrices and uniform agent stubbornness, the optimal strategy involves selecting agents that are sufficiently dispersed across the network.

In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy, characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent: operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level, we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction.

To effectively leverage the generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes in loss and consistency across different views.

Ablation studies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered architecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier configurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1, whose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment of more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over 2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety efficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and multi-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up to an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations. Finally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where integrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40% to 60%."}

The purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7 typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2) generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore, automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base LLMs."}

We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive. Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning."}

We investigate three distinct approaches: a custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features. Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may be \"confused\" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes (ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2 fails on the original, limited dataset but is \"rescued\" by augmentation, highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential. Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.

Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets.

By augmenting each agent's policy objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and final coordination success."}

Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch grammar and contextual coherence.

The robot argued for the correct answer on six questions and the wrong on two, and 75% of the students were persuaded by the robot to perform beyond their expected capacity, positively when the robot was correct and negatively when it was wrong. Students with more experience of using large language models were even more likely to be influenced by the robot's stance -- in particular for the two easiest questions on which the robot was wrong -- suggesting that familiarity with AI can increase susceptibility to misinformation by AI. We further examined how three different levels of portrayed robot certainty, displayed using semantics, prosody and facial signals, affected how the students aligned with the robot's answer on specific questions and how convincing they perceived the robot to be on these questions. The students aligned with the robot's answers in 94.4% of the cases when the robot was portrayed as Certain, 82.6% when it was Neutral and 71.4% when it was Uncertain. The alignment was thus high for all conditions, highlighting students' general susceptibility to accept the robot's stance, but alignment in the Uncertain condition was significantly lower than in the Certain. Post-test questionnaire answers further show that students found the robot most convincing when it was portrayed as Certain. These findings highlight the need for educational robots to adjust their display of certainty based on the reliability of the information they convey, to promote students' critical thinking and reduce undue influence."}

Second, it enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification. Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying levels of reasoning complexity.

In the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach, annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7."}

We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning."}

However, we still lack a consensual mathematical definition or framework, which is necessary for us to hold a deeper understanding of stereotypes in human cognition. In this paper, we use graph theory to portray category stereotypes in human cognition, based on pairs of labels having special relations. By using methods and conclusions in graph theory (including algebraic graph theory and vertex coloring) as well as strict ratiocination, we give criteria for judging the stability of a given stereotype, some of which are computationally practicable. We also define the chromatic stability index (CSI) to measure the stability of a stereotype in human cognition, as well as to provide its precise range. From the perspective of stereotype graphs and CSI, we may explain why stereotypes can easily stay in human cognition."}

This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data, mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems.

To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens.

In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms.

In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as \"worth\" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings."}

Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples.

We expand the search space of algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\\frac{| x |}{\\sigma}^{\\beta} }$ for some $\\beta \\geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\\beta=1$ and $\\beta=2$, respectively.

We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\\beta$ has a weak relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is nearly optimal.

A formulation for active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach. Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike rates, and varying neuron counts."}

Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph distribution.

We create a corpus of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality, especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human tasks."}

Kevin Zhou", "subjects": "Subjects:\nComputer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "abstract": "The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts, impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM), which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and interoperability, verifying its superiority.

With modern mobile devices often featuring network interfaces, state-of-the-art signals of opportunity (SOP) schemes can provide accurate network positions in replacement of GNSS. The use of onboard inertial sensors can also assist in the absence of GNSS, possibly in the presence of jammers. The combination of SOP and inertial sensors has received limited attention, yet it shows strong results on fully custom-built platforms. We do not seek to improve such special-purpose schemes. Rather, we focus on countering GNSS attacks, notably detecting them, with emphasis on deployment with consumer-grade platforms, notably smartphones, that provide off-the-shelf opportunistic information (i.e., network position and inertial sensor data). Our Position-based Attack Detection Scheme (PADS) is a probabilistic framework that uses regression and uncertainty analysis for positions. The regression optimization problem is a weighted mean square error of polynomial fitting, with constraints that the fitted positions satisfy the device velocity and acceleration. Then, uncertainty is modeled by a Gaussian process, which provides more flexibility to analyze how sure or unsure we are about position estimations. In the detection process, we combine all uncertainty information with the position estimations into a fused test statistic, which is the input utilized by an anomaly detector based on outlier ensembles. The evaluation shows that the PADS outperforms a set of baseline methods that rely on SOP or inertial sensor-based or statistical tests, achieving up to 3 times the true positive rate at a low false positive rate."}

To handle the formulated non-convex problem, a gradient-based meta-learning joint optimization (GML-JO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the original problem is initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and antenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex approximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of sub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the sub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where two sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the initial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel coefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are used to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the parameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over different sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm achieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7\\% performance enhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed GML-JO algorithm is robust to different choices of initialization and yields better performance compared with the existing optimization methods."}

However, these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder, achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

We support these claims through illustrative examples and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community.

This question was first raised by Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal and Li (STOC '20), motivated by applications in cryptography, distributed computing, and the unreliable nature of real-world sources of randomness. In their paper, they showed how to construct explicit low-error extractors for just $K \\geq N^{1/2}$ good sources of polylogarithmic min-entropy. In a follow-up, Chattopadhyay and Goodman improved the number of good sources required to just $K \\geq N^{0.01}$ (FOCS '21). In this paper, we finally achieve $K=3$. Our key ingredient is a near-optimal explicit construction of a new pseudorandom primitive, called a leakage-resilient extractor (LRE) against number-on-forehead (NOF) protocols. Our LRE can be viewed as a significantly more robust version of Li's low-error three-source extractor (FOCS '15), and resolves an open question put forth by Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS '19) and Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal, Kumar, Li, Meka, and Zuckerman (FOCS '20).

However, the inherent unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level, Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach, demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities."}

These emerging AI companions raise critical questions: Can such systems fulfill social needs typically met by human relationships? How do they shape psychological well-being? And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to non-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI companions, especially simulated partners on this http URL, and how this use is associated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from 1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244 participants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction, interaction intensity, and self-disclosure. By triangulating self-reports primary motivation, open-ended relationship descriptions, and annotated chat transcripts, we identify patterns in how users engage with AI companions and its associations with well-being. Findings suggest that people with smaller social networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that companionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower well-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage in higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support. Even though some people turn to chatbots to fulfill social needs, these uses of chatbots do not fully substitute for human connection. As a result, the psychological benefits may be limited, and the relationship could pose risks for more socially isolated or emotionally vulnerable users."}

Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain, each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode. Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples. After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations."}

However, they remain prone to visual hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational cost."}

Low", "subjects": "Subjects:\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical alignment."}

To unify and accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning methods and metrics.

Wilson", "subjects": "Subjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)", "abstract": "The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for credit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been proposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as determining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or filtering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on the specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar score. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a composition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual instantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this underspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based valuations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can induce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these valuation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial strategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute value among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical examples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility specifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is left without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These vulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of semivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of justification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss important considerations for identifying appropriate uses."}

DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems."}

Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference."}

In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This approach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures. Our extensive evaluations show that INTERPOS outperforms state-of-the-art models using 7 mobile app recommendation datasets on NDCG@K and HIT@K metrics. The source code of INTERPOS is available at this https URL."}

Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations."}

This requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an explicit understanding of interaction history.

Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations."}

We describe its initial evaluation strategy conducted in a workshop with a network of SE researchers experienced in industry-academia collaboration and report the evaluation of its three assessment criteria (valuable, feasible, and applicable) regarding their importance in assessing practical relevance.

To address this, SC-SOT explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed information about \"who spoke when\". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped speech."}

With the fast development of quantum hardware technology, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and integrated photonics, quantum computers may become reality, accelerating the applications of QNNs. However, preparing quantum circuits and optimizing parameters for QNNs require quantum hardware support, expertise, and high-quality data. How to protect intellectual property (IP) of QNNs becomes an urgent problem to be solved in the era of quantum computing. We make the first attempt towards IP protection of QNNs by watermarking. To this purpose, we collect classical clean samples and trigger ones, each of which is generated by adding a perturbation to a clean sample, associated with a label different from the ground-truth one. The host QNN, consisting of quantum encoding, quantum state transformation, and quantum measurement, is then trained from scratch with the clean samples and trigger ones, resulting in a watermarked QNN model. During training, we introduce sample grouped and paired training to ensure that the performance on the downstream task can be maintained while achieving good performance for watermark extraction. When disputes arise, by collecting a mini-set of trigger samples, the hidden watermark can be extracted by analyzing the prediction results of the target model corresponding to the trigger samples, without accessing the internal details of the target QNN model, thereby verifying the ownership of the model. Experiments have verified the superiority and applicability of this work."}

Manso, George Vogiatzis", "subjects": "Subjects:\nRobotics (cs.RO)", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning for multi-goal robot manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to the diversity and complexity of the goal space. Techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have been introduced to improve learning efficiency for such tasks. More recently, researchers have combined HER with advanced imitation learning methods such as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to integrate demonstration data and accelerate training speed. However, demonstration data often fails to provide enough coverage for the goal space, especially when acquired from human teleoperation. This biases the learning-from-demonstration process toward mastering easier sub-tasks instead of tackling the more challenging ones. In this work, we present Goal-based Self-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (Goal-SAGAIL), a novel framework specifically designed for multi-goal robot manipulation tasks. By integrating self-adaptive learning principles with goal-conditioned GAIL, our approach enhances imitation learning efficiency, even when limited, suboptimal demonstrations are available.

However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback."}

To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands, such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method."}

While numerous jailbreak methods exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes. We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for successful jailbreaking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of adversarial prompt mechanics and offers a new, effective jailbreak technique."}

This task is crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online. We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently, we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."}

We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during inference.

However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we train a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense. Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible compute and latency overhead.

While existing models perform well on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos, GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches."}

In practice, discrete convolutions are often applied repeatedly with a fixed filter. In such cases, we show that the index-reversal permutations involved in both the forward and backward transforms of standard FFT-based convolution implementations can be avoided by deferring to a single offline permutation of the filter.

Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy.

Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize \"single-view\" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per iteration, in contrast to NeRF's \"multi-view\" mini-batch training, which leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However, implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view assumptions.

The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where they have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized organization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients and suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision making enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a data driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price services based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining method recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes and the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different approaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction mechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the mechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated price. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming to develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based on their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on its performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic and stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier capacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online."}

In this paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap. The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods."}

However, most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding (CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across heterogeneous model architectures."}

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

However, their scalability remains limited by spectral bias and the complex loss landscape of PDE-driven training. Domain decomposition mitigates these issues by dividing the environment into smaller subdomains, but existing methods enforce continuity only at individual spatial points. While effective for function approximation, these methods fail to capture the spatial connectivity required for motion planning, where the cost-to-go function depends on both the start and goal coordinates rather than a single query point. We propose Finite Basis Neural Time Fields (FB-NTFields), a novel neural field representation for scalable cost-to-go estimation. Instead of enforcing continuity in output space, FB-NTFields construct a latent space representation, computing the cost-to-go as a distance between the latent embeddings of start and goal coordinates. This enables global spatial coherence while integrating domain decomposition, ensuring efficient large-scale motion planning. We validate FB-NTFields in complex synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing PiNMPs.

These challenges are further amplified in settings involving code-mixing, transliteration, and culturally nuanced expressions. While fine-tuned transformer models, such as BERT, have become standard for this task, we argue that recent large language models (LLMs) not only surpass them but also redefine the landscape of hate speech detection more broadly. To support this claim, we introduce IndoHateMix, a diverse, high-quality dataset capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration in the Indian context, providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate model robustness in complex multilingual scenarios where existing NLP methods often struggle. Our extensive experiments show that cutting-edge LLMs (such as LLaMA-3.1) consistently outperform task-specific BERT-based models, even when fine-tuned on significantly less data. With their superior generalization and adaptability, LLMs offer a transformative approach to mitigating online hate in diverse environments. This raises the question of whether future works should prioritize developing specialized models or focus on curating richer and more varied datasets to further enhance the effectiveness of LLMs."}

DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks.

This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies (\\lambda,\\epsilon)-R\u00e9nyi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection."}

In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm."}

To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

While this shift aligns training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems."}

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3) role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but exhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role models, even outside explicit political contexts.

Smart contracts greatly simplify and refine the traditional business transaction processes, and thus have had a profound impact on various industries such as finance and supply chain management. However, because smart contracts cannot be modified once deployed, any vulnerabilities or design flaws within the contract cannot be easily fixed, potentially leading to significant financial losses or even legal issues. The compiler, as a critical component in the development process, directly affects the quality and security of smart contracts. This paper innovatively proposes a method, known as the Improved Different Optimization Levels (IDOL), for testing the Solidity compiler. The key idea behind IDOL is to perform reverse optimization transformations (i.e., change optimized form into unoptimized form) to generate semantically equivalent variants of the smart contracts under test, aiming to maximize the opportunities to trigger the optimization logic of compilers. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of IDOL and three confirmed compiler optimization bugs have been uncovered at the time of writing."}

We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets.

In this paper, we explore the ``more essential\" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information.

In order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module (LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land.

This paper investigates the relationships between LPMLN and two other extensions of answer set programs: weak constraints to express a quantitative preference among answer sets, and P-log to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. We present a translation of LPMLN into programs with weak constraints and a translation of P-log into LPMLN, which complement the existing translations in the opposite directions. The first translation allows us to compute the most probable stable models (i.e., MAP estimates) of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. This result can be extended to other formalisms, such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to be translatable into LPMLN. The second translation tells us how probabilistic nonmonotonicity (the ability of the reasoner to change his probabilistic model as a result of new information) of P-log can be represented in LPMLN, which yields a way to compute P-log using standard ASP solvers and MLN solvers."}

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an AI-native deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework tailored for resource-constrained 6G networks. Our approach integrates key information extraction and adaptive background synthesis to enable intelligent, semantic-aware transmission. Leveraging AI-driven tools, Mediapipe for human pose detection and Rembg for background removal, the model dynamically isolates foreground features and matches backgrounds from a pre-trained library, reducing data payloads while preserving visual fidelity.

Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its signal quality. Code and datasets will be released."}

Prior work addressing spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based reparameterization.

As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient to unforeseen events, able to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Despite its critical importance, resilience remains an elusive concept, with its mathematical foundations still underdeveloped. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is premised on the fact that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, in terms of elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents (or networks) that can flexibly expand their states, hypotheses and course of actions, by transforming through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This constant situational awareness and vigilance of adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the corresponding best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article seeks to first define resilience and disambiguate it from reliability and robustness, before delving into the mathematics of resilience. Finally, the article concludes by presenting nuanced metrics and discussing trade-offs tailored to the unique characteristics of network resilience."}

To address these limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for interpreting ICL, identify \"surprise\" as an informative signal for class prior shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors, providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing tasks."}

In the case of online learning, when new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources.

In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called \\textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts. Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos, where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to small perturbations, evolves around zero over time. Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular, we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic system parameters.

However, their direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2 distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the complexity of the policy class.

Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency.

Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the $O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\u00ef}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting, leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method with our Pareto-based alternative.

Leveraging a curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents."}

Yoo", "subjects": "Subjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO)", "abstract": "Designing effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as it often requires extensive human effort and domain expertise. While RL from human feedback has been successful in aligning agents with human intent, acquiring high-quality feedback is costly and labor-intensive, limiting its scalability. Recent advancements in foundation models present a promising alternative--leveraging AI-generated feedback to reduce reliance on human supervision in reward learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce ERL-VLM, an enhanced rating-based RL method that effectively learns reward functions from AI feedback. Unlike prior methods that rely on pairwise comparisons, ERL-VLM queries large vision-language models (VLMs) for absolute ratings of individual trajectories, enabling more expressive feedback and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we propose key enhancements to rating-based RL, addressing instability issues caused by data imbalance and noisy labels. Through extensive experiments across both low-level and high-level control tasks, we demonstrate that ERL-VLM significantly outperforms existing VLM-based reward generation methods. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI feedback for scaling RL with minimal human intervention, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient reward learning."}

To address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images. Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR.

However, poor implementation practices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic contexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the optimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to first characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar practices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected stakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes. Also, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond traditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities but fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and feedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking with the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This approach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or where) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities, along with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying \"who was affected and how\" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems thinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex systems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking contributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities, feedback loops, and determining \"when\" to incorporate them in the optimization. Together, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing optimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with normative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar practices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals."}

We experiment with the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models. However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy.

To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts.

In this setting, a $k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance $x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A basic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels states that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list learnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability. However, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary condition. To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example showing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over $\\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This leads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \\emph{$k$-monotone dimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike the multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite $k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies private $k$-list learnability remains an open question."}

This paper revisits the reasoning patterns of Long and Short CoT models, observing that the Short CoT patterns offer concise reasoning efficiently, while the Long CoT patterns excel in challenging scenarios where the Short CoT patterns struggle. To enable models to leverage both patterns, we propose Question-Free Fine-Tuning (QFFT), a fine-tuning approach that removes the input question during training and learns exclusively from Long CoT responses. This approach enables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes the Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary. Experiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces average response length by more than 50\\%, while achieving performance comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits superior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource scenarios."}

Traditional methodologies often rely exclusively on either physics-based or data-driven models, each with complementary strengths and limitations that become most noticeable during critical scenarios. This paper presents a novel consensus multi-model Kalman filter framework that integrates heterogeneous model types to leverage their complementary strengths while minimizing individual weaknesses. We introduce two distinct methodologies for handling covariance propagation in data-driven models: a Koopman operator-based linearization approach enabling analytical covariance propagation, and an ensemble-based method providing unified uncertainty quantification across model types without requiring pretraining. Our approach implements an iterative consensus fusion procedure that dynamically weighs different models based on their demonstrated reliability in current operating conditions. The experimental results conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Equinox vehicle demonstrate performance improvements over single-model techniques, with particularly significant advantages during challenging maneuvers and varying road conditions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology for safety-critical autonomous driving applications."}

Kot, Jiwu Huang", "subjects": "Subjects:\nComputer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have significantly propelled the development of image forgery localization. However, existing models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks: imperceptible noise added to forged images can severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge with an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive perturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe that forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged images exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Forgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy, which reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise Kullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the defensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed Mask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR ensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and original forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their original level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms demonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization model's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to original forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery localization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics dataset."}

(1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2) The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results suggest that different network architectures have different frequency preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial and natural examples may directly influence model robustness.

To address this, semi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining $N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly acceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which suffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning, which incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn a prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and subsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity throughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate the training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in the super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by introducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss. Finally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its excellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data samples.

Motivated by these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with 20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies.

A major limitation of current FHE schemes is their high runtime overhead. As a result, automatic optimization of circuits describing FHE computation has garnered significant attention in the logic synthesis community. Existing works primarily target the multiplicative depth (MD) and multiplicative complexity (MC) of FHE circuits, corresponding to the total number of multiplications and maximum number of multiplications in a path from primary input to output, respectively. In many FHE schemes, these metrics are the primary contributors to the homomorphic evaluation runtime of a circuit. However, oftentimes they are opposed: reducing either depth or complexity may result in an increase in the other. To our knowledge, existing works have yet to optimize FHE circuits for overall runtime, only considering one metric at a time and thus making significant tradeoffs. In this paper, we use e-graphs to augment existing flows that individually optimize MC and MD, in a technique called cut tracing. We show how cut tracing can effectively combine two state-of-the-art MC and MD reduction flows and balance their weaknesses to minimize runtime. Our preliminary results demonstrate that cut tracing yields up to a 40% improvement in homomorphic evaluation runtime when applied to these two flows."}

This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications."}

However, the current neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) -- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis. Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis, we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the role of these mechanisms in biological evolution."}

We perform multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can either \\emph{observe} their partner's internal state ({\\bf cognitive empathy}) or the agent's internal state can be \\emph{directly coupled} to that of their partner ({\\bf affective empathy}). In three simple multi-agent environments, we show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Additionally, we show that empathy can be learned: agents can ``decode\" their partner's external emotive states to infer the partner's internal homeostatic states. Assuming some level of physiological similarity, agents reference their own emotion-generation functions to invert the mapping from outward display to internal state. Overall, we demonstrate the emergence of prosocial behavior when homeostatic agents learn to ``read\" the emotions of others and then to empathize, or feel as they feel."}

This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4 out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on the model's performance and temporal robustness.

In the context of neural video representation, several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to existing INR-based video representation methods."}

While SBM simplifies mesh generation by using a non-conforming background grid, it often results in non-symmetric and potentially ill-conditioned linear systems that are challenging to solve efficiently. Standard multigrid methods with pointwise smoothers prove ineffective for such systems due to the localized perturbations introduced by the shifted boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation for SBM that enables the design of a cell-wise multiplicative smoother within an $hp$-multigrid framework. The element-local nature of DG methods naturally facilitates cell-wise correction, which can effectively handle the local complexities arising from the boundary treatment. Numerical results for the Poisson equation demonstrate favorable performance with mesh refinement for linear ($p=1$) and quadratic ($p=2$) elements in both 2D and 3D, with iteration counts showing mild growth.

Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the source model where the only target model responses used to train the source model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in contextual representations computed by models."}

However, unlike many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas. PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems, demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data, annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to facilitate future research on LLM personalization."}

This makes it natural to try to adapt graph-theoretic results for simplicial complexes, which can model more intricate and detailed structures appearing in real-world systems. In this article, we define the concept of weighted simplicial complex and $d$-path in a simplicial complex. Both these concepts have the potential to have numerous real-life applications. Next, we provide a novel algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted simplicial complex. The core principles of our algorithm align with those of Dijkstra$^\\prime$s algorithm for graphs.

This scheme relies on a neural network built to approximate the problem solution and use a trial function that meets the initial data and boundary criteria. First of all, a brief mathematical formulation of the problem and the structure of PINNs, including the neural network architecture, loss construction, and training methodology is described. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated with five test problems involving variations of the 1D coupled, 2D single and 2D coupled Burgers' models. We compare the PINN-based solutions with exact results to assess accuracy and convergence of the developed algorithm. The results demonstrate that PINNs may faithfully replicate nonlinear PDE solutions and offer competitive performance in terms of inaccuracy and flexibility. This work demonstrates the potential of PINNs as a reliable approach to solving complex time-dependent PDEs."}

Our main contribution is establishing a trade-off between the error-correction capability of the code, the number of reads used in the reconstruction process, and the decoding list size. We show that over a channel that introduces at most $t$ bursts, we can use a length-$n$ code capable of correcting $\\epsilon$ errors, with $\\Theta(n^\\rho)$ reads, and decoding with a list of size $O(n^\\lambda)$, where $t-1=\\epsilon+\\rho+\\lambda$. In the process of proving this, we establish sharp asymptotic bounds on the size of error balls in the burst metric. More precisely, we prove a Johnson-type lower bound via Kahn's Theorem on large matchings in hypergraphs, and an upper bound via a novel variant of Kleitman's Theorem under the burst metric, which might be of independent interest. Beyond this main trade-off, we derive several related results using a variety of combinatorial techniques. In particular, along with tools from recent advances in discrete geometry, we improve the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the asymptotic regime for multiple bursts, and determine the minimum redundancy required for reconstruction codes with polynomially many reads. We also propose an efficient list-reconstruction algorithm that achieves the above guarantees, based on a majority-with-threshold decoding scheme."}

We introduce an AI-powered method for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME), efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class (such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020. To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events: EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred.

Building on the Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration, memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of emergent agent behavior."}

In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends."}

Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility.

Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models."}

Performing a PuD operation involves activating multiple DRAM rows in quick succession or simultaneously, i.e., multiple-row activation. Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from conventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time. However, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce bitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read disturbance. Unfortunately, no prior work investigates the effects of multiple-row activation on DRAM read disturbance. In this paper, we present the first characterization study of read disturbance effects of multiple-row activation-based PuD (which we call PuDHammer) using 316 real DDR4 DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers. Our detailed characterization show that 1) PuDHammer significantly exacerbates the read disturbance vulnerability, causing up to 158.58x reduction in the minimum hammer count required to induce the first bitflip ($HC_{first}$), compared to RowHammer, 2) PuDHammer is affected by various operational conditions and parameters, 3) combining RowHammer with PuDHammer is more effective than using RowHammer alone to induce read disturbance error, e.g., doing so reduces $HC_{first}$ by 1.66x on average, and 4) PuDHammer bypasses an in-DRAM RowHammer mitigation mechanism (Target Row Refresh) and induces more bitflips than RowHammer. To develop future robust PuD-enabled systems in the presence of PuDHammer, we 1) develop three countermeasures and 2) adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation standardized by industry, called Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC). We show that the adapted PRAC incurs large performance overheads (48.26%, on average)."}

In this work, we introduce two hierarchies of new fairness notions: Complement Harmonically Bounded (CHB) and Complement Linearly Bounded (CLB). Intuitively, these notions of fairness ask that, for every agent $i$, the collective value that a group of agents has (from the perspective of agent $i$) is limited. CHB-$k$ and CLB-$k$ coincide with proportionality for $k=1$. For all $k \\leq n$, CHB-$k$ allocations are a superset of envy-free allocations (i.e., easier to find).

Wells, Moon Duchin", "subjects": "Subjects:\nComputer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)", "abstract": "In this paper we develop a novel approach to relaxing Arrow's axioms for voting rules, addressing a long-standing critique in social choice theory. Classical axioms (often styled as fairness axioms or fairness criteria) are assessed in a binary manner, so that a voting rule fails the axiom if it fails in even one corner case. Many authors have proposed a probabilistic framework to soften the axiomatic approach. Instead of immediately passing to random preference profiles, we begin by measuring the degree to which an axiom is upheld or violated on a given profile. We focus on two foundational axioms-Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity (U)-and extend them to take values in $[0,1]$. Our $\\sigma_{IIA}$ measures the stability of a voting rule when candidates are removed from consideration, while $\\sigma_{U}$ captures the degree to which the outcome respects majority preferences. Together, these metrics quantify how a voting rule navigates the fundamental trade-off highlighted by Arrow's Theorem. We show that $\\sigma_{IIA}\\equiv 1$ recovers classical IIA, and $\\sigma_{U}>0$ recovers classical Unanimity, allowing a quantitative restatement of Arrow's Theorem. In the empirical part of the paper, we test these metrics on two kinds of data: a set of over 1000 ranked choice preference profiles from Scottish local elections, and a batch of synthetic preference profiles generated with a Bradley-Terry-type model. We use those to investigate four positional voting rules-Plurality, 2-Approval, 3-Approval, and the Borda rule-as well as the iterative rule known as Single Transferable Vote (STV).

While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B."}

They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations."}

Our analysis reveals that unequal data quality, not just data quantity, is a major driver of performance degradation in bilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective data filtering strategy to select higher-quality bilingual training data with only high quality English data. Applied to French, German, and Chinese, our approach improves monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduces bilingual model performance gaps to 1%.

One common data structure for this purpose is the ring buffer, which maintains a running downsample comprising most recent stream data. In some downsampling scenarios, however, it can instead be necessary to maintain data items spanning the entirety of elapsed stream history. Fortunately, approaches generalizing the ring buffer mechanism have been devised to support alternate downsample compositions, while maintaining the ring buffer's update efficiency and optimal use of memory capacity. The Downstream library implements algorithms supporting three such downsampling generalizations: (1) \"steady,\" which curates data evenly spaced across the stream history; (2) \"stretched,\" which prioritizes older data; and (3) \"tilted,\" which prioritizes recent data. To enable a broad spectrum of applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing nodes and AI/ML hardware accelerators, Downstream supports multiple programming languages, including C++, Rust, Python, Zig, and the Cerebras Software Language.

Most previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles presenting different ideological views.

This graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation."}

Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process, preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases.

Therefore, approaches that use metadata like post timings are required to effectively detect coordinated AI-driven campaigns. Existing work that models the spread of information online is limited in its ability to represent different control flows that occur within the network in practice. Process mining offers techniques for the discovery of process models with different routing constructs and are yet to be applied to social networks.

Most existing studies employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context, especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its effectiveness."}

We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is \\textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the \\textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points.

This Legendre polynomial-exponential basis enables a stable and accurate decomposition in the time variable, effectively reducing the original space-time inverse problem to a sequence of coupled spatial elasticity systems that no longer depend on time. These resulting systems are solved using the quasi-reversibility method.

In this work, we first identify several key pitfalls of the existing unlearning evaluation frameworks, e.g., focusing on average-case evaluation or targeting random samples for evaluation, incomplete comparisons with the retraining baseline. Then, we propose RULI (Rectified Unlearning Evaluation Framework via Likelihood Inference), a novel framework to address critical gaps in the evaluation of inexact unlearning methods. RULI introduces a dual-objective attack to measure both unlearning efficacy and privacy risks at a per-sample granularity. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art unlearning methods, where RULI achieves higher attack success rates, exposing privacy risks underestimated by existing methods.

This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime."}

This study examines the stylistic features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry."}

It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality monolingual embeddings.

Recent advances in this area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content associated with items, such as product descriptions. C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization capacity of recommendation systems. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction tasks.

To this end, we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel views.

This survey traces that full evolution and offers one of the first comprehensive reviews of ReID approaches that leverage LLMs, where textual descriptions are used as privileged information to improve visual matching.

Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods. To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup.

Formally, consider an algorithm for a particular learning task that initially receives a training dataset. Then, after learning, it receives data deletion requests from a subset of users (of arbitrary size), and the goal of unlearning is to perform the task as if the learner never received the data of deleted users. In this paper, we ask how many bits of storage are needed to be able to delete certain training samples at a later time. We focus on the task of realizability testing, where the goal is to check whether the remaining training samples are realizable within a given hypothesis class \\(\\mathcal{H}\\). Toward that end, we first provide a negative result showing that the VC dimension is not a characterization of the space complexity of unlearning. In particular, we provide a hypothesis class with constant VC dimension (and Littlestone dimension), but for which any unlearning algorithm for realizability testing needs to store \\(\\Omega(n)\\)-bits, where \\(n\\) denotes the size of the initial training dataset. In fact, we provide a stronger separation by showing that for any hypothesis class \\(\\mathcal{H}\\), the amount of information that the learner needs to store, so as to perform unlearning later, is lower bounded by the \\textit{eluder dimension} of \\(\\mathcal{H}\\), a combinatorial notion always larger than the VC dimension. We complement the lower bound with an upper bound in terms of the star number of the underlying hypothesis class, albeit in a stronger ticketed-memory model proposed by Ghazi et al. (2023). Since the star number for a hypothesis class is never larger than its Eluder dimension, our work highlights a fundamental separation between central and ticketed memory models for machine unlearning."}

However, perceptual errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system. RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal regions. The system supports a \"second-look\" workflow and offers suggested regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world radiology workflows.

However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface, especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF), with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant advantages of our method."}

By leveraging data from a global Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS) that geolocates BSSIDs, we obtain the physical locations of these devices both pre- and post-sale.

Our work highlights a previously unrecognized privacy vulnerability and suggests, yet again, the strong need to protect layer-two network identifiers."}

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{Metis-RISE} (\\textbf{R}L \\textbf{I}ncentivizes and \\textbf{S}FT \\textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \\textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \\textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall."}

While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution, but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization. This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed, particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs."}

Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami", "subjects": "Subjects:\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences."}

In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \\geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \\begin{align*} O\\bigl(d^{\\frac{7}{4}}\\varepsilon_{\\text{score}}^{\\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\\max})^p\\bigr), \\end{align*} where $\\varepsilon^2_{\\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver.

PRISM2 achieves strong performance on diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning or class enumeration.

To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values.

Existing VIC approaches, however, mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking pedestrians.

This purely combinatorial definition provides a new perspective on the structure of finite metric spaces, distinct from traditional linear-algebraic notions of rank. We establish tight bounds for R(A) in terms of D_A, the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of elements in A. Specifically, we prove that 2qD_A/((q-1)|A|^2) <= R(A) <= D_A/(|A|-1) when |A|/q >= 1, with a modified lower bound for the case |A|/q < 1. These bounds show that the rank is constrained by the metric properties of the subset. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of metrically dense subsets, which are subsets that minimize rank among all isometric images. This notion captures an extremal property of subsets that represent their distance structure in the most compact way possible. We prove that subsets with uniform column distribution are metrically dense, and as a special case, establish that when q is a prime power, every linear subspace of E^n_q is metrically dense. This reveals a fundamental connection between the algebraic and metric structures of these spaces."}

Snoswell, Seth Lazar", "subjects": "Subjects:\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "abstract": "Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems."}

Existing GNNs, unfortunately, fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction, enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks.

However, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum games is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees for both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime. Under symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that Fictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret, establishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric initializations, obtains a similar $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize is a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the first \"fast and furious\" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2."}

These credentials create attack surfaces exploitable by a potential adversary to conduct malicious exploits such as backdoor attacks. Recent detection efforts utilize embedding models to vectorize textual credentials before passing them to classifiers for predictions. However, these models struggle to discriminate between credentials with contextual and complex sequences resulting in high false positive predictions. Context-dependent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) or Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) tackled this drawback by leveraging the transformer neural architecture capacity for self-attention to capture contextual dependencies between words in input sequences. As a result, GPT has achieved wide success in several natural language understanding endeavors. Hence, we assess LLMs to represent these observations and feed extracted embedding vectors to a deep learning classifier to detect hard-coded credentials.

However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics. Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC. Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup."}

To address this, we propose a novel persistent relative 6D state estimation framework that enables a single UUV to estimate its relative motion to a non-cooperative target using only successive noisy range measurements from two monostatic sonar sensors. Our key contribution is an observability-enhanced attitude control strategy, which optimally adjusts the UUV's orientation to improve the observability of relative state estimation using a Kalman filter, effectively mitigating the impact of sensor noise and drift accumulation.

Using two noisy real-time distances measured by drones, guardian drones estimate the relative position from their own to the target using observation and velocity compensation methods, based on anti-synchronization (AS) and an X$-$Y circular motion combined with vertical jitter. An encirclement control mechanism is proposed to enable UAVs to adaptively transition from encircling and protecting a target to encircling and monitoring a hostile target. Upon breaching a warning threshold, the UAVs may even employ a suicide attack to neutralize the hostile target.

A distinctive modeling choice in this method is honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting, but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence, honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice, it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default."}

To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents. However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as well."}

GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting.

We pose the core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in reinsurance markets? In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information. Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints. These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets.

The methods often fail to capture these spatial relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for predictive policing and spatial criminology."}

The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance between complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD) framework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from previous distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes the time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global knowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation based on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the teacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency domains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined allocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to speech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation paradigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set, multi-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated distillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each correlated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that enables inter-set knowledge interaction. The proposed distillation strategy is applied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that ranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge. Objective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed KD strategy consistently and effectively improves the performance of the low-complexity student model and outperforms other distillation schemes."}

To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods."}

We propose to use a structure called Bayesian Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines.

To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent. Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example, when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences. Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training.

For instance, surprisingly, for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward variant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent. Although sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity over gradient descent for various problems, they often involve highly nontrivial subproblems that incur significantly higher per-iteration costs, resulting in a much worse overall operation complexity. These limitations arise from treating the subproblem as an afterthought, either by handling it as a black box, thus permitting complex, highly nontrivial, and nearly unimplementable formulations, or by evaluating subproblem solutions in isolation, without considering their effectiveness in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By tightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem solver and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce simple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton methods, which, in a sense, remain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by retaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference, however, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed based on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables desirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard assumptions, we show that our variants match the worst-case complexity of gradient descent in strongly convex settings, both in iteration and operation complexity, and achieve competitive iteration complexity for general convex problems."}

To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences. Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal features.

They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change."}

In this paper, we find existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations. To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark (i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR, enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. Our codes are at \\href{this https URL}{GitHub}."}

This study investigates the ability of ChatGPT to (1) generate plausible security advisories from CVE-IDs, (2) differentiate real from fake CVE-IDs, and (3) extract CVE-IDs from advisory descriptions. Using a curated dataset of 100 real and 100 fake CVE-IDs, we manually analyzed the credibility and consistency of the model's outputs. The results show that ChatGPT generated plausible security advisories for 96% of given input real CVE-IDs and 97% of given input fake CVE-IDs, demonstrating a limitation in differentiating between real and fake IDs. Furthermore, when these generated advisories were reintroduced to ChatGPT to identify their original CVE-ID, the model produced a fake CVE-ID in 6% of cases from real advisories. These findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT in cybersecurity applications. While the model demonstrates potential for automating advisory generation, its inability to reliably authenticate CVE-IDs or maintain consistency upon re-evaluation underscores the risks associated with its deployment in critical security tasks. Our study emphasizes the importance of using LLMs with caution in cybersecurity workflows and suggests the need for further improvements in their design to improve reliability and applicability in security advisory generation."}

A single binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal. These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning (joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary classification tasks such as sentiment analysis.

In contrast to conventional self-learning approaches, our proposed framework offers an event-driven control strategy and game-theoretic learning algorithms. The players collaborate with the PID controllers to dynamically adjust their gains in response to set point changes and disturbances. We provide a theoretical analysis showing sound convergence guarantees for the game given suitable stability ranges of the PID controlled loop. We further introduce an automatic boundary detection mechanism, which helps the players to find an optimal initialization of action spaces and significantly reduces the exploration time. The efficacy of this novel methodology is validated through its implementation in the temperature control loop of a printing press machine. Eventually, the outcomes of the proposed intelligent self-tuning PID controllers are highly promising, particularly in terms of reducing overshoot and settling time."}

Recently, training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity. We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency."}

While existing neural network-based strategies struggle with computational inefficiency or inadequate temporal dependencies, this study proposes a hybrid control framework integrating a Temporal-Gated Radial Basis Function (TGRBF) network with a nonlinear robust controller. The TGRBF synergizes radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) through dynamic gating, enabling efficient offline system identification and online temporal modeling with minimal parameter overhead (14.5% increase vs. RBFNNs). During control execution, an event-triggered optimization mechanism activates momentum-explicit gradient descent to refine network parameters, leveraging historical data to suppress overfitting while maintaining real-time feasibility. Concurrently, the nonlinear controller adaptively tunes its gains via Jacobian-driven rules derived from the TGRBF model, ensuring rapid error convergence and disturbance rejection. Lyapunov-based analysis rigorously guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of both tracking errors and adaptive parameters. Simulations on a nonlinear benchmark system demonstrate the framework's superiority: compared to PID and fixed-gain robust controllers, the proposed method reduces settling time by 14.2%, limits overshoot to 10%, and achieves 48.4% lower integral time-weighted absolute error under dynamic disturbances. By unifying data-driven adaptability with stability-guaranteed control, this work advances real-time performance in partially observable, time-varying industrial systems."}

This approach enhances user experience and promotes heightened engagement. Nevertheless, user profiling also gives rise to noteworthy privacy considerations due to the extensive tracking and monitoring of personal data, potentially leading to surveillance or identity theft. We propose a dual-ring protection mechanism to protect user privacy by examining various threats to user privacy, such as behavioural attacks, profiling fingerprinting and monitoring, profile perturbation, etc., both on the user and service provider sides. We develop user profiles that contain sensitive private attributes and an equivalent profile based on differential privacy for evaluating personalised services. We determine the entropy of the resultant profiles during each update to protect profiling attributes and invoke various processes, such as data evaporation, to artificially increase entropy or destroy private profiling attributes. Furthermore, we use different variants of private information retrieval (PIR) to retrieve personalised services against differentially private profiles. We implement critical components of the proposed model via a proof-of-concept mobile app to demonstrate its applicability over a specific case study of advertising services, which can be generalised to other services. Our experimental results show that the observed processing delays with different PIR schemes are similar to the current advertising systems."}

They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models."}

We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially degraded.

To fill such a gap, we introduce STEP, a scalable and efficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle counts from a stream of temporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number of triangles a temporal edge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading to scalability, efficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle types simultaneously. We analytically prove that, by using a sublinear amount of memory, STEP obtains unbiased and very accurate estimates. In fact, even noisy predictions can significantly reduce the variance of STEP's estimates. Our extensive experiments on massive temporal graphs with up to billions of edges demonstrate that STEP outputs high-quality estimates and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods."}

In this work, we present GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details. Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9, MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings."}

Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations, offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations, advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding. These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs."}

We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal degradation in overall model utility.

In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java regression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a high-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework designed to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99 regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub repositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark, demonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing both traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our experimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs, while LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these results, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information into LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs.

Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers, which suffer from quadratic computational complexity.

In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.

Concretely, we develop context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM) and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM, our method exhibits faster convergence, \\emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA, and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong baseline methods.

In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for the colorful sum of radii running in FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) time.

To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output.

KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

An FDFA accepts pairs of words, where the first component corresponds to a prefix of the UP-word, and the second component represents a period of that UP-word. An FDFA is termed saturated if, for each UP-word, either all or none of the pairs representing that UP-word are accepted. We demonstrate that determining whether a given FDFA is saturated can be accomplished in polynomial time, thus improving the known PSPACE upper bound by an exponential. We illustrate the application of this result by presenting the first polynomial learning algorithms for representations of the class of all regular $\\omega$-languages. Furthermore, we establish that deciding a weaker property, referred to as almost saturation, is PSPACE-complete. Since FDFAs do not necessarily define regular $\\omega$-languages when they are not saturated, we also address the regularity problem and show that it is PSPACE-complete.

To complement these quantitative representations, we generated semantic captions for each track using LP-MusicCaps and GPT-based summarization. Countries were clustered based on contrastive embeddings that highlight deviations from global musical norms. The resulting clusters were projected into a two-dimensional space via t-SNE for visualization and evaluated against cultural zones defined by the World Values Survey (WVS). Statistical analyses, including MANOVA and chi-squared tests, confirmed that music-based clusters exhibit significant alignment with established cultural groupings. Furthermore, residual analysis revealed consistent patterns of overrepresentation, suggesting non-random associations between specific clusters and cultural zones. These findings indicate that national-level music preferences encode meaningful cultural signals and can serve as a proxy for understanding global cultural boundaries."}

Therein, the platoon is flexible in the sense that no specific spatial ordering sequences of vehicles are predetermined. To attain such a flexible platoon, we first separate the multi-vehicle platoon (MVP) merging mission into two stages, namely, pre-merging regulation and {\\it ordering-flexible platoon} merging, and then formulate them into distributed constraint-based optimization problems. Particularly, by encoding longitudinal-distance regulation and same-lane collision avoidance subtasks into the corresponding control barrier function (CBF) constraints, the proposed algorithm in Stage 1 can safely enlarge sufficient longitudinal distances among adjacent vehicles. Then, by encoding lateral convergence, longitudinal-target attraction, and neighboring collision avoidance subtasks into CBF constraints, the proposed algorithm in Stage~2 can efficiently achieve the {\\it ordering-flexible platoon}. Note that the {\\it ordering-flexible platoon} is realized through the interaction of the longitudinal-target attraction and time-varying neighboring collision avoidance constraints simultaneously. Feasibility guarantee and rigorous convergence analysis are both provided under strong nonlinear couplings induced by flexible orderings. Finally, experiments using three autonomous mobile vehicles (AMVs) are conducted to verify the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed algorithm, and extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate its robustness, adaptability, and scalability when tackling vehicles' sudden breakdown, new appearing, different number of lanes, mixed autonomy, and large-scale scenarios, respectively."}

These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.

We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite."}

However, these methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++, an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation. Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps, respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capability of our proposed method."}

The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's capabilities.

However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines."}

However, existing methods struggle to generate UV albedo maps with high-frequency details. To address this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end coarse-to-fine approach for UV albedo map generation. Our method first utilizes a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM), driven by low-dimensional coefficients, to generate coarse albedo maps with skin tones and low-frequency texture details. To capture high-frequency details, we train a detail generator using a decoupled albedo map dataset, producing high-resolution albedo maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity textures from a single image, outperforming existing methods in terms of texture quality and realism. The code and pre-trained model are publicly available at this https URL, facilitating reproducibility and further research."}

In this work, we show that during the initial \"chaotic\" phase of training, even extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time. We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii) the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories toward distinct loss minima.

S. Quek", "subjects": "Subjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP)", "abstract": "Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements."}

We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced.

This monocultural perspective may reinforce dominant values and marginalize diverse cultural viewpoints, posing challenges for the development of equitable and inclusive AI systems. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework designed to boost fair and robust cross-cultural consensus among LLMs. We model consensus as a Nash Equilibrium and employ a game-theoretic negotiation method based on Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) to simulate an organized cross-cultural negotiation process. To evaluate this approach, we construct regional cultural agents using data transformed from the World Values Survey (WVS). Beyond the conventional model-level evaluation method, We further propose two quantitative metrics, Perplexity-based Acceptence and Values Self-Consistency, to assess consensus outcomes. Experimental results indicate that our approach generates consensus of higher quality while ensuring more balanced compromise compared to baselines.

Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth."}

Building on our earlier work (Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an 8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and (3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a transparent and verifiable way."}

Their construction involves aggregating criteria evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing explainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\" decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale. Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units of interest."}

In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl. Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based, fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7% better mIoU metric than UniScene.

In this paper, we propose to authenticate and authorize in-vehicle services by integrating DNSSEC, DANE, and DANCE with automotive middleware. Our approach decouples the cryptographic authentication of the service from that of the service deployment with the help of DNSSEC and thereby largely simplifies key management. We propose to authenticate in-vehicle services by certificates that are solely generated by the service suppliers but published on deployment via DNSSEC TLSA records solely signed by the OEM. Building on well-established Internet standards ensures interoperability with various current and future protocols, scalable management of credentials for millions of connected vehicles at well-established security levels.

Multi-dimensional pricing, which independently prices each resource, offers an alternative but presents challenges in price discovery. This work focuses on the welfare achieved by these two schemes. We prove that multi-dimensional pricing is superior under stable blockchain conditions. Conversely, we show that one-dimensional pricing outperforms its multi-dimensional counterpart in transient states, exhibiting faster convergence and greater computational tractability.

Given a compromised automatic test oracle and its training test suite, ISONOISE first isolates thetest cases suspected of being mislabelled. This task is performed based on the level of disagreement of a test case with respect to the others. An intermediate automatic test oracle is trained based on the slightly disagreeing test cases. Based on the predictions of this intermediate oracle, the test cases suspected of being mislabelled are systematically presented for relabelling.

As Moodle courses become more complex, incorporating diverse interactive elements, it is important to understand how students navigate through course sections and whether course designs are meeting student needs. While substantial research exists on student usage of individual LMS elements, there is a lack of research on broader navigational patterns between course sections and how these patterns differ across courses. This study analyzes navigational data from 747 courses in the Moodle LMS at a technical university of applied sciences, representing (after filtering) around 4,400 students and 1.8 million logged events. By mapping section names across a large sample of courses, the analysis enables cross-course comparisons of student navigational sequences between sections. Transition matrices and heat map visualizations are used to identify common navigational patterns. Findings include that many of the generated heatmap include one or more diagonal axis, indicating that students typically navigate from the current to the next or previous section. More fine-grained patterns show typical behavior for blended learning scenarios. Other patterns include dominant sections."}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal training costs in a strict black-box setting, ensuring a text-level graph injection attack for TAGs. Experiments on real-world TAG datasets validate the superior performance of ATAG-LLM compared to state-of-the-art embedding-level and text-level attack methods."}

Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign.

This study introduces the RL-Guided MPC framework, where a RL policy is trained and then used to construct a terminal cost and terminal region constraint for the MPC optimization problem. This approach leverages the ability to handle uncertainties of RL with MPC's online optimization to improve overall control performance. The RL-Guided MPC framework is compared with both MPC and RL via numerical simulations. Two scenarios are considered: a deterministic environment and an uncertain environment. Simulation results demonstrate that, in both environments, RL-Guided MPC outperforms both RL and MPC with shorter prediction horizons."}

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Recent model editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses. However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1) Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors, reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\\% and reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\\% over baselines."}

Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics of \"follow-the-regularized-leader\" (FTRL), where the players' payoff observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks. Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, \"uncertainty favors extremes\": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some (possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies. Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the boundary on average."}

However, effectively positioning multiple UAVs in real-time to meet non-uniform, time-varying traffic demands remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming to optimize network throughput and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Multi-UAV Traffic-Aware Deployment (EMTAD) Algorithm, a scalable and adaptive framework that dynamically adjusts UAV placements based on real-time user locations and spatial traffic distribution. In contrast to existing methods, EMTAD jointly optimizes UAV positioning and minimizes the number of deployed UAVs, ensuring efficient UE-UAV association while satisfying the traffic demand of users.

However, existing methods struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in computer-assisted surgery (CAS)."}

While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the original model."}

Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns, while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment.

Through three studies we demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores - indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment.

To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model with Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first propose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to model long-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary position encodings. We then introduce a local short operation to incorporate local preferences and demonstrate the theoretical insight. We further introduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model determine whether a user's behavior indicates local interest or a genuine shift in long-term preferences.

Due to its localized connection characteristics, the square lattice network fosters the long-term coexistence of competing strategies. In contrast, the small-world network is more susceptible to changes in system parameters due to the efficiency of information dissemination and the sensitivity of strategy evolution. Additionally, the reputation mechanism is significant in promoting the formation of a dominant state of cooperation, especially in contexts of high sensitivity to reputation. Although the initial distribution of reputation influences the early stage of the evolutionary path, it has little effect on the final steady state of the system. Hence, we can conclude that the ultimate steady state of evolution is primarily determined by the reputation mechanism and the network structure."}

Unlike conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization, which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose $TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis. This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source localization.

This paper presents a novel framework that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches."}

This approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining instruction-level accuracy."}

This study presents, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index (DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit distinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row orientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for remote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between DpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of their information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide complementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture distinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over the growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the Winkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI appears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific phenological phases. Preliminary results also highlight the potential of DpRVI for distinguishing vineyards from other crops. This research aligns with the objectives of the PNRR-NODES project, which promotes nature-based solutions (NbS) for sustainable vineyard management.

Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two significant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate instances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical semantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or simplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and efficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable contextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance level, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited domain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based coarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential stages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The embedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding method to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as well as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem. The discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for fine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further enhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which leverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to enrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive evaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates that CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining practical efficiency."}

To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework tailored for MoE architectures. Our method systematically tackles these challenges through three key innovations: (1) expert-aware smoothing aggregation to suppress activation outliers and stabilize quantization, (2) router logits distribution alignment to preserve expert selection consistency post-quantization, and (3) expert-level calibration data balance to optimize sparsely activated experts.

Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability."}

Carneiro, Thierry J.

Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However, due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally."}

SNNs focus on timed latency (and possibly probability) of neuronal reactive activation/response, more than numerical computation of filters. So, an SNN model must provide modeling constructs for elementary neural bundles and then for synaptic connections to assemble them into compound data flow network patterns. These elements are to be parametric patterns, with latency and probability values instantiated on particular instances (while supposedly constant \"at runtime\"). Designers could also use different values to represent \"tired\" neurons, or ones impaired by external drugs, for instance. One important challenge in such modeling is to study how compound models could meet global reaction requirements (in stochastic timing challenges), provided similar provisions on individual neural bundles. A temporal language of logic to express such assume/guarantee contracts is thus needed. This may lead to formal verification on medium-sized models and testing observations on large ones. In the current article, we make preliminary progress at providing a simple model framework to express both elementary SNN neural bundles and their connecting constructs, which translates readily into both a model-checker and a simulator (both already existing and robust) to conduct experiments."}

First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale.

We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning.

Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments."}

However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains."}

Existing benchmarks still face challenges in evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models' LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure.

This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled \"Teacher-Student\" architecture, where a \"Teacher AI\" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured \"viewpoints.\" These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a \"Student AI\" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework."}

For the security of Bitcoin, fairness in the distribution of mining rewards plays a crucial role in preventing the concentration of computational power in a few miners. Here, fairness refers to the distribution of block rewards in proportion to contributed computational resources. If miners with greater computational resources receive disproportionately higher rewards, i.e., if the Rich Get Richer (TRGR) phenomenon holds in Bitcoin, it indicates a threat to the system's decentralization. This study analyzes TRGR in Bitcoin by focusing on unintentional blockchain forks, an inherent phenomenon in Bitcoin. Previous research has failed to provide generalizable insights due to the low precision of their analytical methods. In contrast, we avoid this problem by adopting a method whose analytical precision has been empirically validated. The primary contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis that clearly demonstrates TRGR in Bitcoin under the assumption of fixed block propagation delays between different miners. More specifically, we show that the mining profit rate depends linearly on the proportion of hashrate. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of this result from multiple perspectives in scenarios where block propagation delays between different miners are not necessarily fixed."}

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with LCOEs ranging from \\$48.21/MWh to \\$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most significant impact on LCOE, while O&M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro, and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors."}

Current ObjectNav methods heavily depend on prompt engineering for perception and do not address the semantic uncertainty induced by variations in prompt phrasing. Ignoring semantic uncertainty can lead to suboptimal exploration, which in turn limits performance. Hence, we propose a semantic uncertainty-informed active perception pipeline for ObjectNav in indoor environments. We introduce a novel probabilistic sensor model for quantifying semantic uncertainty in vision-language models and incorporate it into a probabilistic geometric-semantic map to enhance spatial understanding. Based on this map, we develop a frontier exploration planner with an uncertainty-informed multi-armed bandit objective to guide efficient object search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves ObjectNav success rates comparable to those of state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring extensive prompt engineering."}

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls."}

Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain. MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric depth with language assistance. (Code is available at: this https URL)"}

We introduce a likelihood-guided noise refinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood score, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient computations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the model-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the generative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve inference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both optimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and flexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple inverse problems, particularly in compressive sensing, delivering high-quality reconstructions even at an extremely low sampling rate (5%)."}

Responses to this phenomenon have varied. Inflationists hold that at least some folk psychological ascriptions to LLMs are warranted. Deflationists argue that all such attributions of mentality to LLMs are misplaced, often cautioning against the risk that anthropomorphic projection may lead to misplaced trust or potentially even confusion about the moral status of LLMs. We advance this debate by assessing two common deflationary arguments against LLM mentality. What we term the 'robustness strategy' aims to undercut one justification for believing that LLMs are minded entities by showing that putatively cognitive and humanlike behaviours are not robust, failing to generalise appropriately. What we term the 'etiological strategy' undercuts attributions of mentality by challenging naive causal explanations of LLM behaviours, offering alternative causal accounts that weaken the case for mental state attributions. While both strategies offer powerful challenges to full-blown inflationism, we find that neither strategy provides a knock-down case against ascriptions of mentality to LLMs simpliciter. With this in mind, we explore a modest form of inflationism that permits ascriptions of mentality to LLMs under certain conditions. Specifically, we argue that folk practice provides a defeasible basis for attributing mental states and capacities to LLMs provided those mental states and capacities can be understood in metaphysically undemanding terms (e.g. knowledge, beliefs and desires), while greater caution is required when attributing metaphysically demanding mental phenomena such as phenomenal consciousness."}

These distance-dependent wiring rules replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias: connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking neural networks.

This paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow, pressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure, cavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis vibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing the SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware platforms. Results demonstrate high classification accuracy (>97%) with zero False Negative Rates for critical Overpressure and Cavitation faults. Smoothed regression outputs achieve Mean Relative Percentage Errors below 1% for flow and pump speed, approaching industrial sensor standards, although pressure prediction requires further refinement. Energy estimates indicate significant power savings, with the Loihi consumption (0.0032 J/inf) being up to 3 orders of magnitude less compared to the estimated x86 CPU (11.3 J/inf) and ARM CPU (1.18 J/inf) execution. Our findings underscore the potential of SNNs for multi-task PM directly on resource-constrained edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient industrial monitoring solutions."}

However, existing calibration methods typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data. Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR (exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments. For the benefit of the community, we have also open-sourced our code and data at this https URL."}

Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics. The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster. To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching. Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of 10x acceleration compared to a previous method."}

To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging problem if a completely error-free solution is needed.

Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic, unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network (SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning process-conditioned by task instructions-generates two-stream object-centric motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and adaptability.

In this paper, we present a Kalman filter (KF) formulation for online identification of the mass and center of mass (COM) of a four-legged robot. We evaluate our method on a quadrupedal robot carrying various payloads and find that it is more robust to strong measurement noise than classical recursive least squares (RLS) methods.

Red teams can exploit LLMs to plan attacks, craft phishing content, simulate adversaries, and generate exploit code. Conversely, blue teams may deploy them for threat intelligence synthesis, root cause analysis, and streamlined documentation. This dual capability introduces both transformative potential and serious risks. This position paper maps LLM applications across cybersecurity frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), offering a structured view of their current utility and limitations. While LLMs demonstrate fluency and versatility across various tasks, they remain fragile in high-stakes, context-heavy environments. Key limitations include hallucinations, limited context retention, poor reasoning, and sensitivity to prompts, which undermine their reliability in operational settings. Moreover, real-world integration raises concerns around dual-use risks, adversarial misuse, and diminished human oversight. Malicious actors could exploit LLMs to automate reconnaissance, obscure attack vectors, and lower the technical threshold for executing sophisticated attacks. To ensure safer adoption, we recommend maintaining human-in-the-loop oversight, enhancing model explainability, integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms, and building systems robust to adversarial exploitation. As organizations increasingly adopt AI driven cybersecurity, a nuanced understanding of LLMs' risks and operational impacts is critical to securing their defensive value while mitigating unintended consequences."}

Starting from an image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently, SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code will be made public."}

Repeating a new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition. While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable, allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech errors in the \"patient\" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects, highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at developing human-like neural models."}

It involves a large number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them, and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language, to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free."}

Self-regulation was underpinned by the influences external to our setting, including labor market-related needs, earlier crises in study habits, and personal characteristics such as passion, grit, creativity, and valuation of utility. Safety in one-to-one supervision was considered essential, while shyness, fear, and even altruism caused self-handicapping during the course.

Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected \"principal\" dimensions are naturally considered as \"salient\" features. The proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3) Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited \"out-of-the-box\" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency."}

The framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure, enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs.

We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger. Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key design challenge.

Our proposed approach is based on a hierarchical control framework, which allows different tasks to be executed according to their assigned priorities. An RL agent is then subsequently utilized to adjust the reference set-point of the lower-priority tasks to perform the swing-up maneuver, which is confined in the nullspace of the higher-priority tasks, such as maintaining a specific orientation and position of the end-effector.

This position paper argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results, supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model merging and practical system designs for practitioners."}

Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance, flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging conditions--critical for data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data.

We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state.

Superimposed codes are foundational combinatorial tools with applications in areas ranging from distributed computing and data retrieval to fault-tolerant communication. However, classical superimposed codes rely on strict alignment assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in asynchronous and fault-prone environments, which are common in modern systems and applications. We introduce Ultra-Resilient Superimposed Codes (URSCs), a new class of codes that extends the classic superimposed framework by ensuring a stronger codewords' isolation property and resilience to two types of adversarial perturbations: arbitrary cyclic shifts and partial bitwise corruption (flips). Additionally, URSCs exhibit universality, adapting seamlessly to any number $k$ of concurrent codewords without prior knowledge. This is a combination of properties not achieved in any previous construction. We provide the first polynomial-time construction of URSCs with near-optimal length, significantly outperforming previous constructions with less general features, all without requiring prior knowledge of the number of concurrent codewords, $k$. % We demonstrate that our URSCs significantly advance the state of the art in multiple applications, including uncoordinated beeping networks, where our codes reduce time complexity for local broadcast by nearly two orders of magnitude, and generalized contention resolution in multi-access channel communication."}

In particular, pBLIMP programs can perform state estimation and base their decisions (i.e. the control flow) on the likelihood that certain conditions hold in the current state. Furthermore, pBLIMP features unbounded loops, which sets it apart from many other probabilistic programming languages. For reasoning about pBLIMP programs and the situations they model, we present a weakest-precondition-style calculus (wp) that is capable of reasoning about unbounded loops. Soundness of our wp calculus is proven with respect to an operational semantics. We further demonstrate how our wp calculus reasons about (unbounded) loops with loop invariants."}

Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g., Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\\% while the current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for a wide array of applications."}

Due to their efficiency and versatility, researchers and companies increasingly employ LLM-generated data to train their models. However, the inability to track content produced by LLMs poses a significant challenge, potentially leading to copyright infringement for the LLM owners. In this paper, we propose a method for injecting watermarks into LLM-generated datasets, enabling the tracking of downstream tasks to detect whether these datasets were produced using the original LLM. These downstream tasks can be divided into two categories. The first involves using the generated datasets at the input level, commonly for training classification tasks. The other is the output level, where model trainers use LLM-generated content as output for downstream tasks, such as question-answering tasks. We design a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate both watermark methods. Our results indicate the high effectiveness of our watermark approach. Additionally, regarding model utility, we find that classifiers trained on the generated datasets achieve a test accuracy exceeding 0.900 in many cases, suggesting that the utility of such models remains robust. For the output-level watermark, we observe that the quality of the generated text is comparable to that produced using real-world datasets. Through our research, we aim to advance the protection of LLM copyrights, taking a significant step forward in safeguarding intellectual property in this domain."}

Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., \"furnishing\") into subclasses (e.g., \"seats\" and \"beds\") and further into specific patent designs.

In addition, DiT exhibits varying performance gains across different resolutions and degrees of parallelism, and significant optimization potential remains unexplored. To address these problems, we present DDiT, a flexible system that integrates both inter-phase and intra-phase optimizations. DDiT focuses on two key metrics: optimal degree of parallelism, which prevents excessive parallelism for specific resolutions, and starvation time, which quantifies the sacrifice of each request. To this end, DDiT introduces a decoupled control mechanism to minimize the computational inefficiency caused by imbalances in the degree of parallelism between the DiT and VAE phases. It also designs a greedy resource allocation algorithm with a novel scheduling mechanism that operates at the single-step granularity, enabling dynamic and timely resource scaling. Our evaluation on the T5 encoder, OpenSora SDDiT, and OpenSora VAE models across diverse datasets reveals that DDiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 1.44x in p99 latency and 1.43x in average latency."}

Despite some research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum. Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection, Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection.

A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed, say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior. The presentation is in two levels.

In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that, for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various blocklengths and code rates.

In this paper, we propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation. To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes."}

SMW-GS incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances.

A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30\\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

Averaging multiple ChatGPT scores improves the results, apparently leveraging its internal probability model. To leverage these probabilities, this article tests two novel strategies: requesting percentage likelihoods for scores and extracting the probabilities of alternative tokens in the responses. The probability estimates were then used to calculate weighted average scores. Both strategies were evaluated with five iterations of ChatGPT 4o-mini on 96,800 articles submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, using departmental average REF2021 quality scores as a proxy for article quality. The data was analysed separately for each of the 34 field-based REF Units of Assessment. For the first strategy, explicit requests for tables of score percentage likelihoods substantially decreased the value of the scores (lower correlation with the proxy quality indicator). In contrast, weighed averages of score token probabilities slightly increased the correlation with the quality proxy indicator and these probabilities reasonably accurately reflected ChatGPT's outputs. The token probability approach is therefore the most accurate method for ranking articles by research quality as well as being cheaper than comparable ChatGPT strategies."}

However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach."}

As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning.

We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines.

Each scalar is enriched with contextual metadata (acquisition time, spatial resolution, wavelength, and bandwidth), producing an atomic representation that allows a single encoder to process arbitrary modalities without interpolation or resampling. Atomizer uses structured tokenization with Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions to encode content and context, and maps tokens into a latent space via cross-attention. Under modality-disjoint evaluations, Atomizer outperforms standard models and demonstrates robust performance across varying resolutions and spatial sizes."}

We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume. This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90 degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction. Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78 planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of 29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity. LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate, personalized treatments."}

In complex scenes containing both clean website fingerprinting features and backdoor triggers, the accuracy of the model on the poisoned dataset and the test dataset is stable at about 80%, significantly outperforming the traditional WF attack models. In addition, the proposed method achieves a 2-3 times speedup in runtime efficiency compared to baseline methods. By incorporating machine unlearning, we realize a WF attack model that exhibits enhanced resistance to backdoor poisoning and faster execution speeds in adversarial settings."}

Our design leverages a bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and comprehensive video understanding."}

To address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP formulations by incorporating key \\mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios.

HPZs compactly encode non-convex reachable states across modes by attaching polynomial exponents to each hybrid generator, enabling precise capture of high-order state-input couplings without vertex enumeration. We develop a comprehensive library of HPZ operations, including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and intersection.

Particularly in rural areas, where public transport is inconvenient to use, private cars are a common choice for commuting and most commuters travel alone in their cars. Consolidation of some of these trips has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions and could be achieved, e.g., by offering ridesharing (commuters with similar origin-destination pairs share a car) or ridepooling (commuters are picked up by shuttle services). In this study, we present a framework to assess the potential of introducing new mobility modes like ridesharing and ridepooling for commuting towards several locations in close vicinity to each other. We test our framework on the case of student mobility to the University of W\u00fcrzburg, a university with several campus locations and a big and rather rural catchment area, where existing public transport options are inconvenient and many students commute by car. We combine data on student home addresses and campus visitation times to create demand scenarios. In our case study, we compare the mobility modes of ridesharing and ridepooling to the base case, where students travel by car on their own. We find that ridesharing has the potential to greatly reduce emissions, depending on the percentage of students willing to use the service and their willingness to walk to the departure location. The benefit of ridepooling is less clear, materializing only if the shuttle vehicles are more energy efficient than the student cars."}

First, we develop {\\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach.

Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models."}

In this article, we present the performance of ICL on partially ordered relation by introducing the notion of inductively increasing complexity in prompts. In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric indicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains constrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of sufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical findings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit optimization process. The code is available \\href{this https URL}{here}."}

A promising approach to this problem is to amplify human judgement by leveraging the power of two competing AIs in a debate about the correct solution to a given problem. Prior theoretical work has provided a complexity-theoretic formalization of AI debate, and posed the problem of designing protocols for AI debate that guarantee the correctness of human judgements for as complex a class of problems as possible. Recursive debates, in which debaters decompose a complex problem into simpler subproblems, hold promise for growing the class of problems that can be accurately judged in a debate. However, existing protocols for recursive debate run into the obfuscated arguments problem: a dishonest debater can use a computationally efficient strategy that forces an honest opponent to solve a computationally intractable problem to win. We mitigate this problem with a new recursive debate protocol that, under certain stability assumptions, ensures that an honest debater can win with a strategy requiring computational efficiency comparable to their opponent."}

These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance"}

To address these issues, we present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL, dubbed EBS-CFL.

Two formulations are introduced. (i) Open-loop, horizon-based covariance propagation uses worst-case uncertainty growth over a finite window to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints. (ii) Closed-loop, covariance-aware planning incorporates a time-varying LQR feedback law in the optimizer, providing a feedback-consistent estimate of disturbance attenuation and enabling sharper yet reliable constraint tightening. Both methods yield reference trajectories for human or artificial drivers: in autonomous applications the modelled controller can replicate the on-board implementation, while for human driving accuracy increases with the extent to which the driver can be approximated by the assumed time-varying LQR policy. Computational tests on a representative Barcelona-Catalunya sector show that both schemes meet the prescribed safety probability, yet the closed-loop variant incurs smaller lap-time penalties than the more conservative open-loop solution, while the nominal (non-robust) trajectory remains infeasible under the same uncertainties. By accounting for uncertainty growth and feedback action during planning, the proposed framework delivers trajectories that are both performance-optimal and probabilistically safe, advancing minimum-time optimization toward real-world deployment in high-performance motorsport and autonomous racing."}

We also show that the proposed sufficient optimality condition leads to a lower hemicontinuous solution set, providing stability against user-input perturbation.

Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features. However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels, which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation. Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning."}

The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies."}

While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics."}

Barfoot", "subjects": "Subjects:\nRobotics (cs.RO)", "abstract": "Occupancy mapping has been a key enabler of mobile robotics. Originally based on a discrete grid representation, occupancy mapping has evolved towards continuous representations that can predict the occupancy status at any location and account for occupancy correlations between neighbouring areas. Gaussian Process (GP) approaches treat this task as a binary classification problem using both observations of occupied and free space. Conceptually, a GP latent field is passed through a logistic function to obtain the output class without actually manipulating the GP latent field. In this work, we propose to act directly on the latent function to efficiently integrate free space information as a prior based on the shape of the sensor's field-of-view. A major difference with existing methods is the change in the classification problem, as we distinguish between free and unknown space. The `occupied' area is the infinitesimally thin location where the class transitions from free to unknown. We demonstrate in simulated environments that our approach is sound and leads to competitive reconstruction accuracy."}

For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs' ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models, partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great compatibility with lengthy narratives.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience."}

We decouple the velocity $\\bm u$ and pressure $p$ by deriving a novel biharmonic equation in $\\Omega$ and third-order boundary conditions on $\\partial\\Omega$. In contrast to the fourth-order streamfunction approach, our formulation does not require $\\Omega$ to be simply connected. For smooth velocity fields $\\bm u$ in two dimensions, we explicitly construct a finite difference method (FDM) with sixth-order consistency to approximate $\\bm u$ at all relevant grid points: interior points, boundary side points, and boundary corner points. The resulting scheme yields two linear systems $A_1u^{(1)}_h=b_1$ and $A_2u^{(2)}_h=b_2$, where $A_1,A_2$ are constant matrices, and $b_1,b_2$ are independent of the pressure $p$ and the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. Thus, the proposed method is pressure- and viscosity-robust. To accommodate velocity fields with less regularity, we modify the FDM by removing singular terms in the right-hand side vectors. Once the discrete velocity is computed, we apply a sixth-order finite difference operator to approximate the pressure gradient locally, without solving any additional linear systems. In our numerical experiments, we test both smooth and non-smooth solutions $(\\bm u,p)$ in a square domain, a triply connected domain, and an $L$-shaped domain in two dimensions. The results confirm sixth-order convergence of the velocity and pressure gradient in the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm for smooth solutions. For non-smooth velocity fields, our method achieves the expected lower-order convergence.

These tensors reside on a curved Riemannian manifold, and accurately modeling their stochastic nature requires preserving both their symmetric positive definite properties and spatial symmetries. To achieve this, uncertainties are parametrized into scaling (magnitude) and rotation (orientation) components, modeled as independent random variables on a manifold structure derived from the maximum entropy principle. The propagation of such stochastic tensors through physics-based simulations necessitates computationally efficient surrogate models. However, traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures are not well-suited for SPD tensors, as directly inputting their components fails to preserve their geometric properties, often leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we introduce Constitutive Manifold Neural Networks (CMNN). This approach introduces a preprocessing layer by mapping the SPD tensor from the curved manifold to the local tangent, a flat vector space, creating an information preserving map for input to the hidden layers of the neural networks. A case study on a steady-state heat conduction problem with stochastic anisotropic conductivity demonstrates that geometry-preserving preprocessing, such as logarithmic maps for scaling data, significantly improves learning performance over conventional MLPs. These findings underscore the importance of manifold-aware techniques when working with tensor-valued data in engineering applications."}

In the resulting equilibrium, the Defender employs a simple Markovian strategy, while the Attacker strategically balances deception and goal efficiency by stochastically mixing shortest and non-shortest paths to manipulate the Defender's beliefs.

An input instance of this problem consists of ``specification sets'' $X_1,\\ldots,X_m \\seq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and a permutation $\\tau$ on $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$. The sets $X_1,\\ldots,X_m$ specify a subset of the symmetric group $\\cS_n$ and the question is whether the given permutation $\\tau$ is a member of this subset. We discuss three subproblems of WPPSG and show that they can be solved efficiently. The subproblem WPPSG$_0$ is the restriction of WPPSG to specification sets all of which are sets of consecutive integers. The subproblem WPPSG$_1$ is the restriction of WPPSG to specification sets which have the Consecutive Ones Property. The subproblem WPPSG$_2$ is the restriction of WPPSG to specification sets which have what we call the Weak Consecutive Ones Property. WPPSG$_1$ is more general than WPPSG$_0$ and WPPSG$_2$ is more general than WPPSG$_1$. But the efficient algorithms that we use for solving WPPSG$_1$ and WPPSG$_2$ have, as a sub-routine, the efficient algorithm for solving WPPSG$_0$."}

To address these issues, we propose DesignCoder, a novel hierarchical-aware and self-correcting automated code generation framework. Specifically, we introduce UI Grouping Chains, which enhance MLLMs' capability to understand and predict complex nested UI hierarchies. Subsequently, DesignCoder employs a hierarchical divide-and-conquer approach to generate front-end code. Finally, we incorporate a self-correction mechanism to improve the model's ability to identify and rectify errors in the generated code. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of UI mockups collected from both open-source communities and industry projects demonstrate that DesignCoder outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in React Native, a widely adopted UI framework. Our method achieves a 37.63%, 9.52%, 12.82% performance increase in visual similarity metrics (MSE, CLIP, SSIM) and significantly improves code structure similarity in terms of TreeBLEU, Container Match, and Tree Edit Distance by 30.19%, 29.31%, 24.67%. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with professional developers to assess the quality and practicality of the generated code. Results indicate that DesignCoder aligns with industry best practices, demonstrating high usability, readability, and maintainability. Our approach provides an efficient and practical solution for agile front-end development, enabling development teams to focus more on core functionality and product innovation."}

This encourages the emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how should a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However, as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2) We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial. (3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP safe ecosystem construction.

In this paper, we make a step towards enabling single-pass bi-directional information passing during query execution. We achieve this by statically analyzing between which tables the information flow is blocked and by leveraging precomputed join-induced fingerprint columns on FK-tables.

This can help improve sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of \"polluting\" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks."}

Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches.

Yu, Yu Liu", "subjects": "Subjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)", "abstract": "Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning."}

A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes."}

Previous approaches can be grouped into two primary \"meta-learner\" paradigms that impose distinct inductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate potential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their difference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize estimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently outperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when the PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is simpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid Learner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between the direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The H-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference closely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual approximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that intentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance tradeoff in estimating CATE. Experiments conducted on semi-synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets illustrate that the H-learner consistently operates at the Pareto frontier, effectively combining the strengths of both direct and indirect meta-learners."}

Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity."}

This work investigates the underlying mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck. Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and representational collapse. We validate that these identified phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language models like Pythia and OLMo."}

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment. Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration, therefore making learning more effective."}

We utilize a large language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset, generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their concerns.

This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines.

We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization."}

TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively.

While previous work prove that SAM improves generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to various test error bounds depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Observing that overfitting can benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax, which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance. Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying difficulties measured by data memorization, yielding decreased feature entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape."}

In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning."}

State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number $\\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\\Omega$-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant $\\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires $O(n\\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$ is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any $\\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle."}

However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this, several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data. Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential, the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic vision for traffic monitoring."}

To exploit the complementary strengths of these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically, OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded.

Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics. Our project page is available at this https URL."}

Because disparity assessments fundamentally depend on the availability of demographic information, their efficacy is limited by the availability and consistency of available demographic identifiers. While prior work has considered the impact of missing data on fairness, little attention has been paid to the role of delayed demographic data. Delayed data, while eventually observed, might be missing at the critical point of monitoring and action -- and delays may be unequally distributed across groups in ways that distort disparity assessments. We characterize such impacts in healthcare, using electronic health records of over 5M patients across primary care practices in all 50 states. Our contributions are threefold. First, we document the high rate of race and ethnicity reporting delays in a healthcare setting and demonstrate widespread variation in rates at which demographics are reported across different groups. Second, through a set of retrospective analyses using real data, we find that such delays impact disparity assessments and hence conclusions made across a range of consequential healthcare outcomes, particularly at more granular levels of state-level and practice-level assessments. Third, we find limited ability of conventional methods that impute missing race in mitigating the effects of reporting delays on the accuracy of timely disparity assessments. Our insights and methods generalize to many domains of algorithmic fairness where delays in the availability of sensitive information may confound audits, thus deserving closer attention within a pipeline-aware machine learning framework."}

We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers.

Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores."}

This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times."}

Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at: this https URL."}

Unlike existing methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning, while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling. Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%."}

Seitz", "subjects": "Subjects:\nGraphics (cs.GR); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "abstract": "We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local, high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple, robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual, in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent, photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input."}

Zhao, Yun Zhang, Zhiyu Huang, Bolei Zhou, Jiaqi Ma", "subjects": "Subjects:\nComputer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "abstract": "Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios."}

Camilletti, G. Franch, E. Tomasi, M. Cristoforetti", "subjects": "Subjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)", "abstract": "We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent, quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather, the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices, describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting."}

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed. The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Paper collection: this https URL"}

By constructing and simulating the digital twins, our approach generates feasible motion trajectories, simulates corresponding outcomes, and prompts the VLM with future observations to evaluate and select the most suitable outcome based on language instructions of the task. To further enhance the capability of pre-trained VLMs in understanding complex scenes for robotic control, we leverage the flexible rendering capabilities of the digital twin to synthesize the scene at various novel, unoccluded viewpoints. We validate our approach on a diverse set of complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods for language-conditioned robotic control using VLMs."}

We introduce VisuoTactile Local (ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable, scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90% success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1) foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs, enabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models, and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models."}

Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention.
